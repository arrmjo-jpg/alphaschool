# AlphaSchool ERP — Administration Frontend Design System

**Status: FROZEN / OFFICIAL — adopted 2026-07-16.** This is the sole design-system reference for building the AlphaSchool ERP Administration frontend, carrying the same governance weight as `docs/ADMIN_PLATFORM.md` and `docs/DOMAIN_BLUEPRINT.md`: no redesign without a real implementation problem, resolved by the smallest possible documented amendment (see §22). No implementation code has been written against it yet; implementation begins per §15/§22.

**Scope.** This document reverse-engineers the visual identity, UX language, and component behavior of the legacy admin (`C:\Users\user\Downloads\alqla-main\alqla-main\admin-frontend`, hereafter **Old Admin**) and specifies how that identity should be rebuilt on top of the already-frozen Admin Platform Foundation (`docs/ADMIN_PLATFORM.md`, ADR-0015; hereafter **New Admin**, the `admin/` directory in this repo). No Old Admin code, business logic, or routing is reused. Only visual language, interaction patterns, and — critically — **user journeys** are preserved. Everything else is new architecture, already built: React 19, TanStack Router/Query/Table, Tailwind v4, Radix UI, React Hook Form, Zod, a Workspace-based information architecture (ADR-0015), and, as of Phase 2, a live Administration Platform backend (Configuration Platform, Provider Registry, Credential Vault).

**Method.** Every claim below is sourced from reading actual files in both codebases — not inferred from framework conventions. Where a finding is a judgment call rather than an observed fact, it is labeled as a recommendation, not a fact.

## 0. Executive Summary

Old Admin is a mature, disciplined, RTL-first Arabic/English CMS admin with a consistent (if quietly self-contradictory) visual identity: a teal brand color, a bilingual Tajawal/Inter font stack, a deliberately flat "no rounded corners anywhere" policy that is in practice violated by nearly every interactive component (buttons, inputs, modals, dropdowns all use `rounded-xl`/`rounded-2xl`), and a calm, low-motion interaction language (`transition-colors` almost everywhere, no scale/translate hover effects). It has real, working CRUD, settings, and system-operations screens with generally good bones — but it also has a working, quantifiable set of UX gaps: a **decorative non-functional search box**, a **stub notifications button with no data source**, **zero unsaved-changes protection anywhere**, **zero settings search/discoverability**, and **duplicated, non-componentized markup** for patterns (sticky save bars, status Row/Card, StatusPanel-shaped feedback states) that appear identically in 3+ places.

New Admin currently has none of this visual identity — it ships the generic shadcn/ui grayscale default theme, system-ui font, and a flat single-level Workspace navigation model with zero business workspaces registered (by design, per ADR-0015 Decision 2: infrastructure-only milestone). It does, however, already have the *right bones* for most of what Old Admin's visual identity needs: a token-driven `@theme` system in `index.css` that Old Admin's brand tokens map onto almost 1:1, and a `--radius` scale that already lands close to the "subtle 6–8px" the user asked for — meaning the radius fix is not a new decision, it's a matter of *not fighting* what's already there, unlike Old Admin's own self-contradiction.

The single largest architectural gap between the two information architectures: Old Admin's navigation is a static, hardcoded two-level tree (`NavSection[]` with collapsible groups); New Admin's navigation is a registry-driven, **flat, single-level** list of self-contained Workspaces. The user's requested new IA (`Administration` as a parent of nine children workspaces, sitting alongside many flat top-level items) needs SideNav to grow a **grouping** concept it does not have today — a small, additive change, not a redesign, and one this document specifies precisely in §8.

## 1. Journey-Based Analysis

Per explicit instruction, this section analyzes Old Admin as journeys, not screens. Every sub-journey below states what exists today, cites the file, and separates *fact* from *judgment*.

### 1.1 First Impression Journey

**Login → Loading → First Dashboard → Empty Workspace**

- **Login** (`features/auth/pages/LoginPage.tsx`, `LoginForm.tsx`): split-screen layout — `AuthLayout.tsx` is `grid min-h-screen lg:grid-cols-2`, left column `AuthCover.tsx` (brand-primary solid background + radial-gradient overlay + a per-route SVG illustration + translated title/subtitle), right column a centered `max-w-sm` form. Recaptcha v2 fallback UI is conditionally rendered inline. Simple two-field form (email, password), forgot-password link, submit button that swaps its own label to a "submitting…" string while pending (no separate spinner element).
- **Fact — mobile has no brand cover at all.** `AuthCover` is `hidden ... lg:flex` — below the `lg` breakpoint (1024px) a user's *first ever impression* of the product is a bare, unbranded, centered form with no illustration, no color, no identity. This is not a graceful degradation; it is a full feature loss on every phone and most tablets.
- **Loading**: `AdminLayout.tsx` shows a single centered `LoadingState` (spinning `Loader2`) while auth status resolves — clean, but it's the *only* loading treatment in the entire first-impression path; there is no skeleton of the eventual layout (no "shell first, content streams in" pattern).
- **First Dashboard** (`features/dashboard/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`): every widget (`SiteKpis`, `RecentContent`, `PendingModeration`, `CacheControls`, `ServerStatus`) is self-contained — fetches its own data, checks its own permission, silently returns `null` if unauthorized. **Fact**: the dashboard page itself performs no top-level permission check; `/` is reachable by any authenticated admin and sections self-hide. For a brand-new user with few permissions, first impression could legitimately be a near-empty page with just `QuickActions` and nothing else — there is no "here's what you can do" onboarding framing for that state, just silence.
- **Empty Workspace**: Old Admin has no equivalent concept (it is not workspace-based) — the closest analogue is a permission-filtered dashboard that renders almost nothing. New Admin already has a *purpose-built* `EmptyWorkspaceState` component (part of the already-frozen Admin Platform Foundation) that Old Admin never needed to solve — this is a case where New Admin's existing infrastructure is already ahead, not behind.

### 1.2 CRUD Journey

**List → Search → Filter → Details → Create → Edit → Delete → Success**

Traced end-to-end through `features/user-management/{pages/UsersPage.tsx, pages/UserFormPage.tsx, hooks.ts}` as the most complete real CRUD flow in the codebase.

- **List**: `DataTable` + `Pagination` + `SearchInput`, page state lives in the URL (`useSearchParams`) — good, deep-linkable, refresh-safe. Loading state fades the table to `opacity-70` rather than blanking it (`transition-opacity duration-200`) while a background refetch (e.g. after a filter change) is in flight — a good, low-jank pattern.
- **Search**: `SearchInput` debounces client-side (350ms) before writing to the URL — server does the actual filtering. No "searching…" affordance during the debounce window itself, only once the request fires (covered by the table's own opacity dim).
- **Filter**: four independent native `<select>` dropdowns (account type, status, role, trashed) laid out in a flat `flex flex-wrap` toolbar row. **Judgment**: functionally fine, but there is no "N filters active" indicator, no one-click "clear all filters," and no saved/named filter concept — a user with 3 filters active has no visual summary of that state beyond re-reading each dropdown's current value.
- **Details**: Old Admin has **no dedicated detail/view page** for Users — clicking a row's actions opens an edit form directly, or a dropdown menu of point actions (reset password, verify email, delete). There is no read-only "view" state distinct from "edit" state anywhere observed in this flow.
- **Create / Edit**: `UserFormPage.tsx` — a single, long, section-carded form (`Panel` wrapper, 6 sections: Profile/Basic/Security/Bio/Social/Roles) used for **both** create and edit via one `isEdit` boolean, including the password fields (edit mode just relabels "Password" to "Leave blank to keep current"). Client validation failure triggers **both** an inline per-field error **and** a toast (`toastError`) — a deliberate double-signal, not a bug. Server-side 422 validation errors are mapped back onto the correct RHF field (`applyServerErrors`) rather than shown as a generic banner — a good pattern.
- **Fact — no unsaved-changes protection.** Nothing in `UserFormPage.tsx` checks `formState.isDirty` before navigation; clicking "Back to list" or any sidebar link while mid-edit discards all typed changes with zero warning, zero confirmation. Confirmed absent by direct code inspection, not assumed.
- **Delete**: routed through `useToast().confirm()` (a SweetAlert2 modal, not the app's own `Modal` component — see §Technical Debt) — title/text/confirm-label/cancel-label, returns a boolean. Used identically for delete, restore, password-reset, and email-verify — i.e., **every** destructive-or-sensitive action gets the same generic yes/no gate, with no differentiation by risk level (deleting a user and verifying an email use the exact same dialog weight).
- **Success**: on successful create/update, the only feedback is a `navigate(paths.users)` — an implicit "you're back on the list, so it worked" signal, not an explicit success toast. (Delete/restore/reset actions, by contrast, likely do toast — success feedback is inconsistent across actions within the same page.)

### 1.3 Settings Journey

**Navigation → Discoverability → Search → Categories → Save → Validation → Unsaved Changes**

Traced through `features/settings/{components/SettingsNav.tsx, components/SettingsSection.tsx, components/SaveBar.tsx, pages/GeneralSettingsPage.tsx}`.

- **Navigation**: `SettingsNav` is a static, hardcoded list of 7 items (General, Branding, Email, Social, Analytics, Media Storage, Newspaper), rendered as `NavLink`s in a bordered panel — horizontally scrollable on mobile (`flex gap-1 overflow-x-auto ... lg:flex-col`), vertical tabs on desktop.
- **Discoverability / Search**: **Fact — there is no search of any kind inside Settings.** No search box, no fuzzy-match, no keyboard shortcut. Seven categories is manageable by eye today; it will not scale to the dozens of Configuration Platform keys the new architecture is designed to support (ADR-0018's whole registration model assumes potentially hundreds of declared keys across every module).
- **Categories**: one page per category, one form per page (`GeneralSettingsPage` alone has 6 `SettingsSection` cards covering site identity, contact, footer, controls, and map coordinates — a lot of unrelated concerns sharing one page and one save action).
- **Save**: each settings page has its own independent `<form>` and its own `SaveBar` — there is no unified "you have pending changes across N settings pages" concept, by design (each page saves independently). `SaveBar` correctly disables the Save button and shows a permission-denial note when the user lacks `settings.edit`, rather than hiding the fields entirely — a good, honest "you can look, you can't touch" pattern worth keeping.
- **Validation**: Zod schema + RHF, same inline-error pattern as the CRUD forms. Fine.
- **Unsaved changes**: **Fact — identical gap to the CRUD journey, confirmed directly in `GeneralSettingsPage.tsx`.** No `isDirty` check, no route-change guard. Clicking any other item in `SettingsNav` while mid-edit — a single, un-confirmed click — silently discards everything typed. Worse than the CRUD case because Settings pages are long (6 sections, ~20 fields on the General page alone), so the amount of work at risk per accidental click is larger.
- **A second, more severe finding in this journey**: `GeneralSettingsPage.tsx` includes a **`maintenance_mode` toggle** — an action that takes the entire public site offline — as one `SwitchField` among ~20 other benign fields on the same form, saved by the exact same "Save" button with the exact same lack of ceremony as changing a copyright string. There is no elevated confirmation for this specific field, even though the same codebase clearly has a `confirm()` mechanism it uses for far lower-stakes actions elsewhere (e.g. "restore a user").

### 1.4 Administrative Journey

**Notifications → Audit → Background Jobs → Health → Integrations**

- **Notifications** (`layouts/components/NotificationsButton.tsx`): **Fact, confirmed by an explicit code comment** — this is a structural stub. The Arabic comment reads (translated): *"purely a structural/skeleton notifications element — no notifications endpoint in scope."* The dropdown always renders an `EmptyState`. There is no real notification data anywhere in the admin's notification affordance.
- **Audit** (`features/user-management/pages/ActivityLogPage.tsx`): genuinely solid — filterable by module/event/date range, each row expandable to show an old→new attribute diff (`<s>` strikethrough old value → new value) plus free-form context key/values, all forced `dir="ltr"` correctly since diffs are technical data. This is the strongest single page in the Administrative Journey and a good pattern to carry forward almost as-is.
- **Background Jobs** (`features/system/pages/FailedJobsPage.tsx`): real bulk-action UX — per-row and select-all checkboxes, bulk retry/delete, "retry all"/"delete all" (both gated behind `confirm()`), server-truncated exception text with a native `title` tooltip for the full message. A reasonable, working pattern.
- **Health** (`features/system/pages/DiagnosticsPage.tsx`): a manual-refresh (no auto-poll, no live-updating) dashboard of environment info, driver names, and boolean-badge connectivity checks (`okBadge`/`boolBadge` helpers), plus a manual "clear content cache" destructive action (correctly gated behind `confirm()`, and correctly notes in its own copy that the action is audited).
- **Integrations**: Old Admin has a flat `thirdParty`/`cdn` settings page (`features/third-party`, `features/cdn` — not read in full detail for this pass, referenced via nav config) rather than any Provider-Registry-shaped concept — there is no equivalent in Old Admin to what New Admin's backend now actually has (Phase 2's Provider Registry + Credential Vault: multi-provider-per-capability, health checks, credential sensitivity). Old Admin's Integrations journey is strictly less sophisticated than what the new backend already supports; the frontend gap here is the opposite of most of this document — New Admin's *backend* has already outgrown what Old Admin's *frontend* ever needed to represent.
- **Cross-cutting observation**: `DiagnosticsPage`'s `Row`/`Card` pair and `FailedJobsPage`'s bulk-toolbar pattern are each hand-rolled once per page rather than shared — see Technical Debt (§17).

### 1.5 Mobile Responsiveness Journey

- Sidebar collapses to a full-screen drawer with backdrop-blur below `lg` (not a persistent icon rail — Old Admin has no "collapsed-but-visible" state on mobile, only "hidden" or "full overlay").
- Auth cover disappears entirely below `lg` (§1.1 — a real feature loss, not graceful degradation).
- The Topbar's decorative search "button" is hidden below `md` — meaning the one piece of UI that looks most like global search doesn't even *pretend* to exist on mobile.
- Toolbars (filter rows, bulk-action rows) consistently use `flex flex-wrap` / `flex-col sm:flex-row`, which is a functional but visually unrefined mobile pattern — filters wrap into a ragged multi-line block rather than collapsing into a "Filters" disclosure the way a more considered mobile-first table toolbar would.
- Tables have no card/list fallback view for narrow screens — `DataTable`'s only mobile accommodation is `overflow-x-auto` on the table container, i.e. horizontal scroll. On a phone, the Users table (6 columns including an avatar/name compound cell) is genuinely difficult to use.
- **Judgment**: none of this is broken, but "responsive" here means "does not visually break," not "is designed for," which is a meaningfully lower bar.

### 1.6 Accessibility Journey

**What's good, confirmed by direct inspection:**
- Consistent `aria-invalid` wiring from RHF field state into styled `aria-[invalid=true]:` Tailwind variants (not a separate visual "error" prop needing manual sync).
- `aria-label` present on icon-only buttons (theme toggle, language switch, chat/contact/notification bells, mobile menu trigger).
- `aria-expanded` on the collapsible sidebar group buttons, `aria-current="page"` on the active nav link.
- A consistent `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring` treatment across buttons, inputs, dropdown items — never relying on the browser's unstyled default outline, and correctly using `:focus-visible` (keyboard-only) rather than `:focus` (which would ring on every mouse click too).

**What's missing or inconsistent, confirmed by direct inspection:**
- **No skip-to-content link** anywhere in `AdminLayout.tsx` — a keyboard/screen-reader user must tab through the entire sidebar on every single page before reaching main content.
- **No `aria-live` region** for toast notifications (SweetAlert2 toasts are visual-only by default configuration; nothing in `useToast.ts` adds `role="status"`/`aria-live="polite"`) — a screen-reader user gets no announcement that a save succeeded or failed.
- **The decorative Topbar search button is a genuine accessibility anti-pattern**, not just a UX one: it is a focusable, `aria`-unlabeled-as-decorative element that visually and semantically presents as a functional search input/button to any assistive technology, but does nothing when activated. A screen-reader user has no way to distinguish it from real search.
- **Password-visibility toggle uses `tabIndex={-1}`**, deliberately removing it from the tab sequence — defensible (keeps tab order moving straight from password field to next field) but means a keyboard-only user cannot reveal the password without a mouse, an inconsistency worth a deliberate decision either way rather than an unstated default.
- **Custom controls built without Radix** (`SwitchField`'s hand-rolled `<button role="switch" aria-checked>`, `Modal.tsx`'s hand-rolled dialog) each re-implement keyboard/focus-trap behavior independently rather than inheriting it from one audited primitive — real risk of subtle divergence (e.g., does the hand-rolled `Modal` trap focus? Does Escape work identically to Radix's own Escape handling? Not verifiable without a dedicated a11y audit, which is itself the finding: unaudited custom interactive primitives are a standing risk.)

### 1.7 RTL Journey

**What's good, confirmed by direct inspection:**
- Pervasive, correct use of Tailwind logical properties (`ps-`/`pe-`, `start-`/`end-`, `border-e`, `ms-auto`) rather than physical `left`/`right`/`ml`/`mr` — this is the single most consistently well-executed pattern in the entire codebase.
- Deliberate, correct `dir="ltr"` overrides on genuinely LTR content inside an RTL page: phone numbers, dates, email fields, exception stack traces, activity-log diff values, URLs — checked in at least six separate files, always applied precisely to the LTR-content span, never to a whole page or section.
- SweetAlert2 toast position swaps `top-start`/`top-end` based on resolved direction, keeping toasts anchored to the reading-start corner in both languages.
- The `RangeFilter`'s native date inputs are correctly forced `dir="ltr"` even inside an otherwise-RTL analytics panel, since calendar dates read left-to-right by convention regardless of UI language.

**What's inconsistent, confirmed by direct inspection:**
- `Pagination.tsx` swaps chevron icons via a dual-render `rtl:hidden`/`ltr:hidden` pair (two icons, one hidden by direction) rather than a single icon with a `rtl:rotate-180` transform — works, but is double the markup for the same visual result, and is inconsistent with the `rtl:rotate-180` pattern used elsewhere in the same codebase (e.g. `UserFormPage`'s "back to list" arrow).
- No `[dir]`-scoped visual regression testing evidenced anywhere (no Storybook, no RTL snapshot tests) — RTL correctness today is a product of careful authorship, not a verified, protected invariant.

## 2. UX Mistakes Inventory

Each entry: the problem, why it's a problem, who is affected and how, and the concrete fix for AlphaSchool ERP.

### M1 — Decorative, non-functional search button in the Topbar
**Problem.** `Topbar.tsx` renders a styled element that looks exactly like a search input (icon, placeholder text, input-shaped border/background) but has no `onClick`, no state, does nothing when interacted with.
**Impact.** Every user's very first instinct on any admin dashboard — "let me search for X" — fails silently. There is no error, no redirect, nothing: the UI simply doesn't respond, which reads as *broken*, not *absent*. This is worse for trust than not having the element at all.
**Fix.** New Admin already has a real `SearchBar` component wired to `SearchProvider` and a real Command Palette (`⌘K`). Never ship a visual affordance without the mechanism behind it — if a capability isn't ready, omit the control entirely rather than fake it.

### M2 — Stub notifications with a hardcoded empty state
**Problem.** `NotificationsButton.tsx` is explicitly documented in its own source comment as a stub with no backing endpoint.
**Impact.** Same trust erosion as M1, compounded: the bell icon has a badge-slot ready to show an unread count, priming the user to expect real notifications, then delivering nothing every single time.
**Fix.** New Admin's `notification-center.tsx` is already wired to a real `use-notifications` hook and query. Ship it only once there is a real notification source (the backend's Notification Engine, or Administration Platform events), not before.

### M3 — Zero unsaved-changes protection, anywhere
**Problem.** Confirmed absent in both the CRUD form (`UserFormPage.tsx`) and every Settings page (`GeneralSettingsPage.tsx` and, by pattern, its siblings). No `isDirty` check, no navigation guard, no `beforeunload` handler.
**Impact.** Silent data loss on the single most common accidental action in any admin UI: clicking a nav link while mid-form. The longer the form (Settings pages run 15–20 fields), the larger the loss per incident.
**Fix.** A router-level "confirm navigation" guard (TanStack Router supports `onBeforeUnload`/blocking navigation via a shared hook) wired to RHF's `formState.isDirty`, reused by every form in the new admin — this belongs in the Form platform layer (`platform/forms/`), not per-page.

### M4 — A destructive, site-wide action (`maintenance_mode`) has the same UI weight as a cosmetic field
**Problem.** The maintenance-mode toggle lives inside a general settings form, saved by the same button, with the same lack of ceremony, as changing a copyright string.
**Impact.** A misclick or a moment of inattention can take the public-facing product offline, with no distinguishing friction from any other harmless edit on the same page.
**Fix.** High-blast-radius toggles need a proportional confirmation step — reusing the same `confirm()`-class mechanism the app already applies to far lower-stakes actions (deleting a user), or, better, routing through the backend's existing Approval Engine / step-up-auth mechanisms this ERP already built for exactly this class of decision (Phase 1's `ApprovalRoutingResolver`, Identity's step-up OTP flow) rather than inventing a frontend-only confirmation.

### M5 — No settings search or discoverability at scale
**Problem.** Settings navigation is a flat, static 7-item list with no search.
**Impact.** Works today; will not work once the Configuration Platform's registration model (ADR-0018) is actually populated by every module — that architecture is explicitly designed to support potentially hundreds of declared keys across dozens of modules. A flat visual list does not scale past roughly a dozen items before a user has to scan every label to find one setting.
**Fix.** The New Admin's Command Palette (`⌘K`, already built) is the natural discoverability mechanism — settings keys should be indexable there, plus a dedicated in-workspace search filtering the Configuration Registry's own metadata (key, capability, owning module) once the Administration Workspace exists.

### M6 — Duplicated, non-componentized UI patterns
**Problem.** The exact same sticky-bottom "save bar" markup (`sticky bottom-4 z-10 ... rounded-2xl border ... shadow-soft backdrop-blur`) is hand-written twice — once inline in `UserFormPage.tsx`, once as the dedicated `SaveBar.tsx` component used by Settings. The `Row`/`Card` status-display pair in `DiagnosticsPage.tsx` is a local, page-scoped implementation of a pattern that visually recurs elsewhere. The three `feedback.tsx` components (`LoadingState`, `ErrorState`, `EmptyState`) already *are* componentized, but share an identical centered-column/icon-in-a-rounded-square layout that isn't itself factored into a shared base.
**Impact.** Not user-facing directly, but a direct source of future visual drift — the next engineer who needs a save bar or a status card will very likely hand-roll a third slightly-different version rather than find and reuse the first two, which is exactly how "one product, several inconsistent styles" architectures happen.
**Fix.** Componentize `StickyActionBar`, `StatusPanel` (unifying Loading/Error/Empty), and `KeyValueRow`/`InfoCard` (Diagnostics' `Row`/`Card`) once, in the New Admin's shared component layer, before any second consumer needs them — this is exactly the kind of "promotion, not prediction" judgment call the backend architecture already applies (Blueprint Addendum B1), now applied to the frontend.

### M7 — No differentiation of confirmation weight by risk
**Problem.** Delete-a-user, restore-a-user, reset-a-password, and verify-an-email all route through the identical `confirm()` dialog — same title/body length, same button styling, same lack of "type the name to confirm" friction regardless of reversibility or blast radius.
**Impact.** Either the low-stakes actions feel needlessly heavy (restoring a user shouldn't require the same ceremony as permanently deleting one), or — more likely, since humans habituate to repeated friction — the high-stakes actions stop feeling meaningfully different from the low-stakes ones, defeating the purpose of the confirmation entirely ("confirmation fatigue").
**Fix.** At least two tiers: a lightweight inline confirm (e.g. a two-click "Delete → Confirm" button swap) for reversible/low-risk actions, and a modal requiring explicit acknowledgment (possibly typed confirmation for the most severe cases, e.g. permanent deletion bypassing soft-delete) for irreversible/high-risk ones.

### M8 — No detail/view state distinct from edit
**Problem.** Old Admin has no read-only "view" page for its most complete CRUD resource (Users) — only list and edit.
**Impact.** A user who only has `users.view` (not `users.edit`) permission and clicks into a user record either sees an edit form with disabled fields (if that's even wired — not confirmed present) or cannot drill in at all. Neither state was directly observed as handled.
**Fix.** New Admin's DataTable/form platform should support a genuine read-only detail view as a first-class state, not a permission-disabled edit form — clearer information hierarchy, and a natural home for related-record context (audit history for this specific record, related entities) that a cramped edit form isn't built to show.

### M9 — Password change bundled into the general profile-edit megaform
**Problem.** `UserFormPage.tsx` handles create and edit with one form, including two password fields that are simply blank-means-no-change in edit mode.
**Impact.** Password/credential changes are a materially more sensitive operation than editing a bio or social links, but are visually and procedurally identical to them here — no extra verification step, no separate confirmation flow.
**Fix.** This ERP's own backend already has a purpose-built step-up authentication mechanism (Identity's OTP-based step-up flow, proven as Phase 1's own consumer). Sensitive credential changes in the new admin should route through that mechanism as a distinct, elevated flow — not a blank-to-keep text field buried in a long form.

### M10 — Inconsistent success feedback
**Problem.** Some mutations (delete, restore, cache-clear) appear to trigger an explicit success toast; the CRUD create/edit flow's only "success" signal is an implicit `navigate()` back to the list.
**Impact.** Users learn to distrust the absence of an error as confirmation of success — a save that silently redirects is indistinguishable, in the split-second after clicking Save, from a save that silently failed and redirected anyway.
**Fix.** Every mutation gets an explicit, consistent success acknowledgment (toast or equivalent) — never an implicit "no news is good news" pattern — enforced at the mutation-hook layer (a shared `useMutation` wrapper), not left to each page author's discretion.

## 3. Experience Improvements

Everything in this section is something AlphaSchool ERP's admin should do *better* than Old Admin, while a first-time returning user still visually recognizes it as "the same product, evolved" — not a rewrite.

1. **Real, working global search from day one** (§M1) — the Command Palette and `SearchBar` already exist in New Admin's platform layer; the discipline is to never ship a decorative substitute again.
2. **Real notifications only when real data exists** (§M2) — New Admin's `notification-center.tsx` is already query-backed; ship the UI and the data source together, always.
3. **Universal unsaved-changes protection** (§M3) — one shared hook (`useUnsavedChangesGuard` or similar) wired into every form via the platform's `forms/` layer, so no individual page author can forget it.
4. **Risk-tiered confirmations** (§M4, §M7, §M9) — a small, explicit taxonomy (reversible / destructive / high-blast-radius) driving which confirmation mechanism a given action uses, reusing the backend's existing Approval Engine and step-up-auth for the top tier rather than a frontend-only modal.
5. **Settings discoverability that scales** (§M5) — Command-Palette-indexed Configuration keys plus in-workspace search, designed against the real cardinality the Configuration Platform's architecture already anticipates (hundreds of keys), not against Old Admin's seven static categories.
6. **A componentized shared layer from the start** (§M6) — `StickyActionBar`, `StatusPanel`, `KeyValueRow`/`InfoCard` built once in `platform/components`, so the "write it twice, slightly differently" pattern never has the chance to start.
7. **A genuine read-only detail view** (§M8) as a first-class DataTable/Workspace pattern, not an afterthought.
8. **Consistent, universal success feedback** (§M10) enforced at the data-layer (a shared mutation wrapper), never left to per-page discretion.
9. **A real mobile experience, not just a non-broken one** (§1.5) — a card/list fallback for dense tables below a breakpoint, a collapsed-filters disclosure instead of a wrapping toolbar, and — critically — **the brand identity must survive on mobile auth**, where Old Admin lost it entirely.
10. **Accessibility as a built platform guarantee, not a per-component effort** (§1.6) — a skip-to-content link in `AppShell` once, `aria-live` toast announcements built into the shared toast hook once, and every interactive primitive built on audited Radix behavior rather than hand-rolled reimplementations (this is already largely true in New Admin's current component set — the discipline is to keep it true as the library grows, never reach for a hand-rolled `<button role="switch">` when `@radix-ui/react-switch` is one dependency away).
11. **RTL correctness as a protected invariant, not just a well-authored convention** — the logical-properties discipline Old Admin already does well should be enforced (a lint rule flagging physical `left/right/ml/mr` in new component code) rather than relying on every future author independently knowing the convention.
12. **A visual identity with an honest radius story** — Old Admin's own "no radius anywhere" policy is violated by nearly every real interactive component (`rounded-xl` buttons/inputs/modals, `rounded-full` badges/avatars). AlphaSchool ERP should adopt one consistent, intentional radius scale from day one (§4) rather than inherit a policy the original codebase itself never actually followed.
13. **A subtly richer motion language where it earns its keep** — Old Admin's flat `transition-colors`-everywhere approach is calm and appropriate for a dense admin UI, and should mostly be preserved; the one addition worth making is purposeful entrance/exit motion for the pieces of New Admin that Old Admin never had to solve for cleanly (modal/drawer/command-palette open+close should feel considered, not just present).

## 4. Design Tokens

### 4.1 Color

Old Admin's tokens (light mode), HSL, from `src/styles/globals.css`:

| Token | Old Admin (light) | Old Admin (dark) | New Admin default (light, OKLCH) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--background` | `210 40% 99%` | `215 19% 22%` | `oklch(1 0 0)` (pure white) |
| `--foreground` | `215 28% 17%` | `210 24% 95%` | `oklch(0.145 0 0)` (near-black) |
| `--card` | `0 0% 100%` | `215 17% 27%` | `oklch(1 0 0)` |
| `--primary` | `202 44% 41%` (brand `#3B7597`) | `202 58% 60%` | `oklch(0.205 0 0)` (grayscale placeholder) |
| `--secondary` / `--muted` | `210 30% 96%` | `215 14% 33%` | `oklch(0.97 0 0)` |
| `--accent` | `202 44% 95%` | `202 34% 38%` | `oklch(0.97 0 0)` (grayscale) |
| `--destructive` | `0 72% 51%` | `0 62% 54%` | `oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)` |
| `--border` / `--input` | `214 24% 91%` | `215 13% 38%` | `oklch(0.922 0 0)` |
| `--ring` | `202 44% 41%` | `202 58% 60%` | `oklch(0.708 0 0)` |

**Recommendation.** New Admin's `--theme inline` mapping in `admin/src/index.css` is already token-driven and already documents `--primary` as *"the organization brand-color slot ... the one token a dedicated-instance customer's branding is expected to override"* (ADR-0006). This is the correct integration point: replace New Admin's grayscale `--primary`/`--accent` OKLCH values with AlphaSchool's brand teal (`hsl(202 44% 41%)`, convertible to OKLCH), and derive `--accent` as a light tint of `--primary` (Old Admin's own `202 44% 95%` relationship) rather than a neutral gray. `--background`/`--foreground`/`--border` should shift from pure grayscale toward Old Admin's very-slightly-blue-tinted neutrals (`210 40% 99%` background, `215 28% 17%` foreground) — a subtle but real part of the "same feeling" the user asked for; pure `oklch(1 0 0)`/`oklch(0.145 0 0)` reads colder than Old Admin's actual palette.

Status colors used inline (not tokenized) in Old Admin: `emerald-500/600` (success/ok), `amber-500/600` (warning), `sky`/`violet`/`rose` (dashboard KPI accent tones). **Recommendation**: promote `success`/`warning` to real semantic tokens (`--success`, `--warning`) alongside the existing `--destructive`, rather than leaving them as ad hoc Tailwind palette classes scattered through component code — this is the one place Old Admin's own token discipline fell short and New Admin should not repeat.

**Amendment (2026-07-20): light-mode `--border`/`--input` contrast increased.** The value adopted at Phase A (`214 24% 91%`, the Old Admin light-mode value from the table above, carried through unchanged) sat only ~8-9 lightness points below `--card`/`--background` (100%/99%), subtle enough to blend into the surface on some displays — cards, inputs, tables, and section dividers all lost visible definition. Changed to `214 20% 84%` in `admin/src/index.css` — darkened and very slightly desaturated so it reads as a calm neutral line rather than a colored one as it becomes more visible, still inside the same hue family, still a token-level change (every surface using `--border`/`--input` picks it up automatically, no component override). Dark mode's `--border`/`--input` (`215 13% 38%`) is untouched — it was never the complaint. Verified live: computed-style check confirms the new value in light mode and the original byte-for-byte in dark mode, zero console errors.

### 4.2 Typography

- **Fact**: Old Admin's font stack is `Tajawal` (weights 400/500/700) for the default/Arabic path and `Inter` (400/500/600/700) for `html[lang='en']`, loaded via a single Google Fonts `@import`, with a fallback chain to `system-ui, sans-serif`.
- **Recommendation**: keep this exact pairing and weight set — it is a deliberate, correct choice for a bilingual Arabic/Latin product (Tajawal has genuinely good Arabic metrics; Inter is a strong Latin pairing at similar x-height/weight). New Admin's current `system-ui` body font (`index.css:118`) should be replaced with this pairing, self-hosted rather than Google-Fonts-CDN-loaded if this project's privacy/offline posture warrants it (not confirmed either way — flag as an open question, not a decision made here).
- **Scale**: Old Admin uses Tailwind's default type scale directly (`text-2xl font-bold` page titles, `text-sm` body, `text-xs` meta/helper text, `text-lg font-bold` modal titles) — no custom scale, no design-token-driven sizing. **Recommendation**: keep using Tailwind's default scale; introducing a custom one would be effort spent on a problem Old Admin never actually had.

### 4.3 Spacing, Radius, Elevation

- **Spacing**: consistently Tailwind's default 4px-based scale (`gap-3`, `p-4`/`p-5`/`p-6`, `space-y-5`/`space-y-6`). No custom spacing scale. Container: `mx-auto max-w-screen-2xl` with responsive padding `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8`.
- **Radius — the central, explicit change request.** Old Admin's Tailwind config *forces every radius token to `0`* (`borderRadius: { none: '0', sm: '0', DEFAULT: '0', ... full: '0' }`, with an Arabic comment translating to "fixed preference: no border-radius at all on any element — complete flattening"). **This policy is not actually followed** — nearly every real interactive component overrides it locally: buttons and inputs use `rounded-xl` (0.75rem), modals/dropdowns use `rounded-2xl` (1rem), badges and avatars use `rounded-full`. The *only* genuinely radius-0 surfaces are the Sidebar/Topbar/AdminLayout chrome itself and the `AnalyticsKit`/dashboard `Panel`/`MetricCard` components, whose own source comment explicitly states *"no border-radius (system policy)"* — i.e., the flat-square treatment is real and intentional specifically for **structural chrome and data-density surfaces**, while **interactive controls were always meant to be soft**.
  **Recommendation, directly answering the user's explicit instruction:** adopt New Admin's *already-present* radius scale (`--radius: 0.625rem` ≈ 10px base, with `sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl` derived via `calc()`) as the single source of truth — this already lands almost exactly in the requested 6–8px "subtle modern radius" range (`--radius-sm` = 6px, `--radius-md` = 8px). Apply it **uniformly**: no more silent contradiction between a "0 everywhere" config and a codebase that never actually does that. Structural/chrome/dense-data surfaces (sidebar, topbar, table container, dashboard KPI cards) may reasonably use the smaller end of the scale or none at all for a crisp, dense feel; interactive controls (buttons, inputs, modals, dropdowns, badges) use the standard scale. This preserves Old Admin's *actual* visual result (soft interactive elements, crisp structural chrome) while replacing its *self-contradicting policy* with one honest, consistent scale.
- **Elevation**: two custom shadow tokens, `soft` (`0 1px 2px 0 rgb(16 24 40 / 0.04), 0 8px 24px -6px rgb(16 24 40 / 0.08)`) and `soft-lg` (a stronger version), used for cards, modals, dropdowns, tooltips, and sticky action bars. **Recommendation**: port both tokens verbatim into New Admin's Tailwind theme — they are a genuinely well-tuned, restrained shadow system (cool neutral `rgb(16 24 40)`, low opacity, large soft blur) worth keeping exactly as-is.

### 4.4 Motion

- One custom keyframe, `fade-in` (`opacity 0→1` + `translateY(4px)→0`, `0.25s ease-out`), applied to: page content on route change, mobile sidebar drawer, `AuthLayout`'s form column, `Modal` overlay+panel, Radix dropdown/tooltip content (via `data-[state=open]:animate-fade-in`).
- Two explicit longer transitions: sidebar width (`transition-[width] duration-200`) and content padding (`transition-[padding] duration-200`) kept in lockstep during collapse/expand.
- Everything else defaults to Tailwind's implicit 150ms `transition-colors`/`transition-transform`.
- **No scale or translate hover effects anywhere** — confirmed by direct search across all reviewed components. This is a deliberate, calm, "flat" motion language appropriate for a dense admin product.
- **Recommendation**: port the `fade-in` keyframe and the two 200ms width/padding transitions verbatim. Preserve the "no hover scale/translate" discipline as an explicit rule, not an accident — it is the right choice for information density, and a design system document should say so out loud so a future contributor doesn't "improve" it into a busier, less calm product.

## 5. Layout System

| Surface | Old Admin | New Admin today | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sidebar (expanded) | Fixed `w-64`, `border-e`, flush to viewport edge, no margin | `w-56` (`SideNav`), same `border-e bg-card` shape | Converge on Old Admin's `w-64` — slightly more breathing room for bilingual labels (Arabic labels run longer than English at the same font size) |
| Sidebar (collapsed) | `w-16`, icon-only + Radix tooltip on hover | `w-14`, icon-only, no tooltip observed | Add tooltip-on-collapse (Old Admin pattern) — without it, a collapsed icon-only rail is not self-explanatory |
| Sidebar grouping | Two-level: flat items + collapsible titled groups, auto-open on active route, manual toggle overridden until route changes | **Flat, single level only** — `WorkspaceDefinition` has no grouping concept | **The one real architectural gap** — see §8 |
| Header/Topbar | `h-16`, sticky, `bg-background/80 backdrop-blur` | `h-14`, not sticky, opaque `bg-background` | Adopt Old Admin's sticky + translucent-blur treatment; height difference (16 vs 14) is minor, keep New Admin's 14 for slightly denser chrome unless testing shows otherwise |
| Content container | `mx-auto max-w-screen-2xl`, `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8` | Unconstrained width, no consistent page padding convention observed | Adopt Old Admin's container + padding scale verbatim |
| Mobile nav | Full-screen overlay drawer, backdrop-blur, `animate-fade-in` | Radix `Sheet` (already equivalent primitive) | Already architecturally equivalent — apply the visual tokens (backdrop-blur, fade-in) to the existing `Sheet` usage |
| Breadcrumbs | Two-level only (Dashboard root + current section), not a true trail | None observed yet in New Admin | Old Admin's breadcrumb is honestly under-built (§Technical Debt) — New Admin should build a *real* multi-level trail (Workspace → Group → current page), since the new nested IA (§8) genuinely needs it more than Old Admin's flatter one did |
| Settings-style layout | Vertical tab nav + card-sectioned form + sticky save bar | Not yet built | Build per §3 pt. 4/6 — search-augmented nav, componentized `StickyActionBar` |
| Dashboard layout | `space-y-6` vertical stack: header → quick actions → KPI row → content grids → server status | `Dashboard` component: responsive `grid` of `WidgetDefinition`s, 1/2/4 columns | Compatible shapes — New Admin's widget grid can absorb Old Admin's visual card language (see §6) without an architecture change |
| RTL | Logical properties throughout (`ps-`/`pe-`/`border-e`/`start-`/`end-`) | Already used in the files read (`SideNav`, `TopBar`) | Continue the discipline; add a lint rule (§3 pt. 11) |
| Sticky elements | Topbar (sticky top), save bars (sticky bottom) | Topbar not currently sticky | Make Topbar sticky; save-bar-as-sticky-bottom is a pattern worth adopting wholesale (§6, `StickyActionBar`) |

**Layout** (`layouts/`): AdminLayout, Sidebar, Topbar, Breadcrumbs, UserMenu, NotificationsButton (stub), ThemeToggle, ChatButton, ContactButton, AuthLayout, AuthCover.
**Not present at all** (confirmed absent): charting library (hand-rolled instead), date-picker library (native `<input type="date">`), combobox/autocomplete library (native `<select>`), rich text editor beyond Tiptap, drag-and-drop library (raw DOM events), any Checkbox/Radio primitive beyond raw `<input>`, any Tabs primitive beyond `NavLink`-styled-as-tabs, any Accordion beyond the sidebar's own bespoke collapsible groups, any Command Palette, any real Notification Center, any Wizard/multi-step form pattern, any Timeline component, any Drawer distinct from the mobile nav overlay.

### 6.2 New Admin's current component set (as built, pre-this-document)

`platform/components/ui/`: Avatar, Button, Dialog (Radix), Dropdown Menu (Radix), Input, Label (Radix), Select (Radix), Separator (Radix), Sheet (Radix), Table, Tooltip (Radix).
`platform/forms/`: TextField, SelectField, DateField, BilingualNameField (a New-Admin-only pattern, needed by this ERP's bilingual data model — Old Admin has no equivalent since it's not a bilingual-*data* product, only a bilingual-*UI* one), map-server-errors helper.
`platform/data-table/`: a generic TanStack-Table-backed DataTable + server-pagination hook.
`platform/modals/`: modal-host, modal-store, confirm-dialog (`useConfirm`, Dialog-based — already a real Radix `Dialog`, unlike Old Admin's hand-rolled `Modal`).
`platform/widgets/`, `platform/dashboard/`: WidgetDefinition registry + responsive grid renderer.
`platform/notifications/`: notification-center (already query-backed, ready for real data).
`platform/command-palette/`: full `cmdk`-based command palette + registry.
`platform/search/`: SearchBar + provider.
`platform/shell/`: AppShell, SideNav, TopBar, WorkspaceRoutePage, EmptyWorkspaceState, HomePage, LoginPage.
`platform/theme/`: theme-store (light/dark, already token-driven).

### 6.3 Gap analysis

New Admin already has architecturally *better* foundations than Old Admin in several places (Radix-based Dialog/Switch/Select instead of hand-rolled equivalents are available as dependencies even though Switch/Checkbox/Radio/Tabs aren't yet wired into `ui/`; a real Command Palette; a query-backed Notification Center; a bilingual name field Old Admin never needed). What New Admin is missing, purely in inventory terms, relative to what Old Admin's *visual identity* requires to feel familiar:

- Badge, Skeleton, Textarea, Switch (wire the existing Radix dependency), Checkbox, Radio, Tabs — not present in `platform/components/ui/` yet.
- SearchInput (list-scoped, debounced) — distinct from the global `SearchBar`.
- Pagination (Old Admin's numbered-with-ellipsis pattern) — DataTable currently only has prev/next.
- Feedback trio (LoadingState/ErrorState/EmptyState) as one componentized `StatusPanel` family — currently absent from `platform/`.
- PasswordField, SecretField (credential-configured indicator), SliderField.
- FileUploadField, JsonUploadField (dropzone pattern) — relevant immediately for Phase 2's Credential Vault UI (uploading a service-account JSON, e.g. Firebase's `private_key`, is a literal near-term need).
- AnalyticsKit equivalents (MetricCard, TrendChart, BarRow, Panel) for dashboard/KPI work.
- StickyActionBar (§M6), KeyValueRow/InfoCard (§M6), IconBadge (the repeated chat/contact unread-badge pattern, §Technical Debt).
- A real multi-level Breadcrumbs component (Old Admin's own is under-built, §Technical Debt — build this one properly rather than porting the weak version).

---

## 7. Page Templates

Derived from the journey analysis (§1), not from a page-by-page inventory, per the instruction to preserve experience rather than screens. Each template names the *shape* a New Admin page should follow, generalized past its one Old Admin example.

1. **List Template** — header (title + subtitle + primary "New" action) → filter/search toolbar (bordered panel) → data surface (table on desktop, card list on mobile per §3 pt. 9) → pagination. Loading = opacity-dim the existing surface during refetch, skeleton rows only on true first load.
2. **Form Template (Create/Edit)** — breadcrumb trail → title → section-carded fields (`Panel`-equivalent, icon + title + hint per section) → sticky bottom `StickyActionBar` (back + save). Unsaved-changes guard mandatory (§M3). A genuine read-only Detail Template (§M8) as a sibling, not a fallback.
3. **Settings/Configuration Template** — vertical category nav (search-augmented per §M5) + card-sectioned form per category + `StickyActionBar` save, permission-aware disable-with-note (Old Admin's `SaveBar disabled` pattern is good, keep it). Risk-tiered confirmation for high-blast-radius fields (§M4).
4. **Dashboard Template** — quick actions (permission-filtered, self-hiding) → KPI row → content/trend grids, every widget self-contained (own loading/error/permission-guard) exactly as Old Admin's `DashboardPage` already does well — this pattern generalizes cleanly onto New Admin's existing `WidgetDefinition` registry with no architecture change needed.
5. **Administrative/Diagnostic Template** — status-badge grid (`KeyValueRow`/`InfoCard`, §6.3) + manual refresh + audited destructive actions, following `DiagnosticsPage`'s shape but componentized.
6. **Audit/Activity Template** — filterable table + expandable per-row diff detail, following `ActivityLogPage`'s shape close to verbatim — it is the single best-executed page in Old Admin.
7. **Bulk-Operations Template** (Background Jobs) — select-all + per-row select + a bulk-action toolbar that only renders when the permission is held, following `FailedJobsPage`'s shape.
8. **Auth Template** — split-screen brand cover + centered form, **with a mobile-safe brand treatment** that Old Admin never built (§3 pt. 9) — e.g. a compact brand mark + solid-color header strip on narrow screens instead of full disappearance.

---

## 8. Navigation Specification

### 8.1 The architectural gap

New Admin's `WorkspaceDefinition` (`platform/navigation/workspace-definition.ts`) is intentionally flat: one workspace = one top-level nav entry = one lazily-loaded, fully self-contained component, rendered by `SideNav` as a single un-grouped list. This is correct and sufficient for most of the user's requested IA (`People`, `Identity`, `Academic`, `Students`, `Guardians`, `Employees`, `Attendance`, `Finance`, `HR`, `Infrastructure`, `Website`, `Reports`, `Developer`, `System` — all naturally flat, independent workspaces). It is **not** sufficient for the one deliberately nested item in the requested hierarchy:

```
Administration
    Configuration Platform
    Provider Registry
    Notifications
    Digital Experience
    Mobile
    Integrations
    AI Providers
    Audit
    Experience Layer
```

Each of those nine children is, correctly, its own independently-registerable capability in the backend architecture (Configuration Platform and Provider Registry already exist as real, separate Phase 1/2 deliverables; the others follow the same Registry-Pattern shape). Representing each as its own `WorkspaceDefinition` is architecturally *right* — but `SideNav` has no way to visually cluster nine flat top-level icons under one "Administration" parent the way Old Admin's `Sidebar.tsx` clusters, say, its seven `userManagement` items under one collapsible group.

**Frozen decision (naming).** The Administration child originally named `Website` in the draft is renamed **Digital Experience**, resolving the naming collision flagged in the draft's §16.1. The top-level `Website` workspace (§8.3) is unchanged in scope and ownership — it remains responsible for **CMS, Pages, Menus, Rendering, and Public Content**. `Administration > Digital Experience` is a distinct capability, owning:

- Branding
- Login Experience
- Domains
- SEO
- Analytics
- Tracking
- Social Presence
- PWA
- Public Identity

The distinction: `Website` owns *what the public sees and reads* (content); `Digital Experience` owns *how the organization presents itself across every surface* (identity, discoverability, and the login/entry experience specified in §20) — a platform-wide concern that happens to also govern the public website's branding layer, not a subset of the website's own content model. This is the same Administration/Operations boundary test already applied throughout the backend (ADR-0016 §3: Administration owns low-cardinality, low-churn reference/identity concerns; Website's own CMS content is the high-cardinality, high-churn operational data it is never Administration's job to own).

### 8.2 Recommendation — the smallest fix, not a redesign

Add one optional field to `WorkspaceDefinition`: `group?: { key: string; labelKey: string; icon: LucideIcon }`. `SideNav` renders workspaces sharing the same `group.key` under one collapsible header (Old Admin's exact interaction: click to toggle, auto-open when any child route is active, chevron rotates 180° on expand — `transition-transform`, no duration override, matching §4.4's motion inventory). Workspaces with no `group` render exactly as today, flat. This is additive to an already-frozen extension point (mirrors precisely how the backend added `ProviderSlotDefinition`'s permission fields additively in Phase 2 without reopening Phase 1 — the same discipline, applied to the frontend) — it does not change `AppShell`, routing, or any existing registered workspace's own code, and a workspace with no `group` is byte-for-byte unaffected.

### 8.3 Proposed top-level structure

```
Dashboard                                    (no group — flat, always first)
People                                       (flat)
Identity                                     (flat)
Academic                                     (flat)
Students                                     (flat)
Guardians                                    (flat)
Employees                                    (flat)
Attendance                                   (flat)
Finance                                      (flat)
HR                                           (flat)
Administration                               (group)
    Configuration Platform
    Provider Registry
    Notifications
    Digital Experience
    Mobile
    Integrations
    AI Providers
    Audit
    Experience Layer
Infrastructure                               (flat)
Website                                      (flat — CMS, Pages, Menus, Rendering, Public Content only; naming collision with Administration's former "Website" child resolved by renaming that child to Digital Experience, see 8.1)
Reports                                      (flat)
Developer                                    (flat)
System                                       (flat)
```

### 8.4 Other navigation behaviors to port from Old Admin

- **Auto-open groups on active route, single-item highlight via longest-path-match** — Old Admin's `Sidebar.tsx` resolves the *longest* matching nav path as active (so `/content/reels/analytics` highlights only itself, never its parent `/content/reels` too) — port this exact matching algorithm, it correctly prevents the "two things look active at once" bug a naive `startsWith` check would produce.
- **Manual toggle overridden by route change** — a user's manual expand/collapse of a group is a *session-scoped override*, reset the moment navigation moves outside that group. Preserves user intent without letting a stale manual collapse hide the page they're currently on.
- **Tooltip-on-hover when collapsed** — every collapsed-rail icon gets a Radix tooltip with the item's label; this is currently missing from New Admin's `SideNav` even in its flat form (§5) and should be added regardless of the grouping work.
- **Permission-gated at the item level**, not just the workspace level — Old Admin filters individual nav items by permission before deciding whether to render their parent group at all (a group with zero visible children renders nothing, not an empty header). New Admin's `useVisibleWorkspaces` already does the workspace-level equivalent (server-computed access); the same discipline should extend to sub-items within a grouped workspace's own internal navigation once built.

---

## 9. UX Specification

Consolidates the interaction rules a component library must obey, derived from the journeys and the improvements list. This is the section a future implementer should check a new screen against.

- **Every mutation gets exactly one, explicit, consistent success acknowledgment.** Never an implicit "silent redirect = success" (§M10).
- **Every form with any field checks `isDirty` before allowing navigation away, no exceptions.** (§M3)
- **No visual affordance ships before its mechanism does.** (§M1, §M2) — an empty/disabled/hidden control is always preferable to a fake one.
- **Confirmation weight is proportional to risk**, using a shared, named risk taxonomy (reversible / destructive / high-blast-radius), never a single one-size-fits-all dialog. (§M4, §M7, §M9)
- **List pages never blank-and-reflow during a background refetch** — dim the existing content (`opacity-70`-class treatment), reserve skeleton rows for true first-load only. (Old Admin already does this correctly — preserve it.)
- **Every icon-only interactive element has an `aria-label`, no exceptions** — audited at component-library level via a lint rule, not per-author discipline. (§1.6)
- **Every page/component new to the New Admin platform layer is built on an audited Radix primitive where one exists** — never hand-roll a Switch, Dialog, or Dropdown when the dependency is one `npm i` away and already partially in use. (§1.6)
- **Logical CSS properties only** (`ps-`/`pe-`/`start-`/`end-`/`border-e`/`border-s`) — a lint rule should flag `ml-`/`mr-`/`left-`/`right-` in new component code, converting Old Admin's well-executed *convention* into an enforced *invariant*. (§1.7)
- **`dir="ltr"` is applied surgically to genuinely-LTR content spans** (dates, emails, phone numbers, technical IDs, stack traces, URLs) inside RTL layouts — never to a whole page/section as a blunt instrument. (§1.7)
- **Radius is applied per the single unified scale (§4.3)** — chrome/dense-data surfaces may use the low end or none; every interactive control uses the standard scale. No component silently overrides radius to fight the system default the way Old Admin's own components fought its own config.
- **Motion stays calm** — `transition-colors`/`transition-transform` for interactive-state changes, the one `fade-in` keyframe for entrance, no hover scale/translate effects, matching Old Admin's restrained language exactly. (§4.4, §3 pt. 13)

## 10. Component Mapping — Old Component → New Component

| Old Component | New Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `components/ui/Button` | `platform/components/ui/button.tsx` | Already exists; port `soft` shadow on default/destructive variants, keep `rounded-*` per §4.3's unified radius scale |
| `components/ui/Badge` | *(to build)* `platform/components/ui/badge.tsx` | Port variant set (default/success/muted/destructive) + `rounded-full` |
| `components/ui/Modal` (hand-rolled) | `platform/modals/*` (Radix `Dialog`-based) | **Upgrade, not port** — New Admin's Dialog is already Radix-based; apply Old Admin's visual tokens (soft-lg shadow, fade-in, `rounded-2xl`, 3-size scale) to it, discard the hand-rolled focus-trap/ESC logic entirely |
| `components/ui/Input` | `platform/components/ui/input.tsx` | Already exists; port `h-11 rounded-xl` sizing + `aria-[invalid=true]` variant styling |
| `components/ui/Avatar` | `platform/components/ui/avatar.tsx` | Already exists; port fixed-size + `bg-primary/10 text-primary` fallback treatment |
| `components/ui/DropdownMenu` | `platform/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` | Already exists (Radix); port `rounded-2xl shadow-soft-lg` content styling |
| `components/ui/Tooltip` | `platform/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` | Already exists (Radix); port inverted-color-scheme styling |
| `components/ui/Separator`, `Skeleton` | `platform/components/ui/separator.tsx`; *(to build)* `skeleton.tsx` | Separator exists; Skeleton needs building, trivial (`animate-pulse rounded-* bg-muted`) |
| `components/data/DataTable` | `platform/data-table/data-table.tsx` | **Upgrade, not port** — New Admin's is TanStack-Table-backed (real sorting/column config) vs. Old Admin's static-header table; port the visual language (rounded-2xl border container, muted header row, hover row tint, RTL-safe `align` prop) onto the existing, more capable engine |
| `components/data/Pagination` | *(to build)* `platform/data-table/pagination.tsx` | Port numbered-with-ellipsis logic, fix the dual-icon RTL swap into a single `rtl:rotate-180` (§1.7 inconsistency) |
| `components/data/SearchInput` | *(to build)* `platform/data-table/search-input.tsx` | Port debounce + icon-inset pattern, distinct from the global `SearchBar` |
| `components/form/TextField` | `platform/forms/text-field.tsx` | Already exists; port error-below-field + no-asterisk convention (see §11 re: required-field indication, a genuine improvement opportunity) |
| `components/form/SelectField` | `platform/forms/select-field.tsx` | Already exists as Radix-based (an upgrade over Old Admin's native `<select>`); port visual tokens only |
| `components/form/PasswordField`, `SecretField` | *(to build)* | Port show/hide toggle + `SecretField`'s "configured" badge — directly relevant to Phase 2's Credential Vault forms |
| `components/form/SwitchField` (hand-rolled) | *(to build, on Radix Switch)* | **Upgrade, not port** — rebuild on `@radix-ui/react-switch` (already a resolvable dependency per New Admin's package set), port the bordered-row visual layout only |
| `components/form/SliderField`, `TextareaField`, `TestButton` | *(to build)* | Straightforward ports |
| `components/upload/FileUploadField`, `JsonUploadField` | *(to build)* | Direct port of dropzone pattern; near-term need for Credential Vault file-based secrets (e.g. Firebase service-account JSON) |
| `components/analytics/AnalyticsKit` (MetricCard, TrendChart, BarRow, Panel, RangeFilter, DeferredNotice) | *(to build)* `platform/widgets/*` additions | Port visual language onto the existing `WidgetDefinition` registry; `DeferredNotice`'s "don't show fake numbers" honesty pattern is worth explicitly preserving |
| `components/feedback` (LoadingState/ErrorState/EmptyState/PageSkeleton) | *(to build)* `platform/components/status-panel.tsx` | Componentize as one shared-base family (§M6) rather than three parallel implementations |
| `layouts/AdminLayout`, `Sidebar`, `Topbar` | `platform/shell/app-shell.tsx`, `side-nav.tsx`, `top-bar.tsx` | Already exist; apply visual tokens + the grouping extension (§8) |
| `layouts/components/Breadcrumbs` | *(to build, properly this time)* | Do not port Old Admin's 2-level-only implementation verbatim — build a genuine multi-level trail, since the new grouped IA needs it more |
| `layouts/components/UserMenu` | Extend `top-bar.tsx`'s existing dropdown | Already architecturally present; port visual tokens |
| `layouts/components/NotificationsButton` | `platform/notifications/notification-center.tsx` | **Already ahead of Old Admin** — already query-backed; do not port the stub, only the bell+badge visual treatment |
| `layouts/components/ThemeToggle` | `platform/theme/*` + a `top-bar.tsx` addition | Theme store already exists; port the tooltip-wrapped dual-icon-button visual pattern |
| `layouts/components/ChatButton`, `ContactButton` | *(to build)* `platform/components/icon-badge-button.tsx` | Componentize the repeated unread-badge pattern once (§M6), consume it for both, and for any future icon-badge need |
| `layouts/AuthLayout`, `AuthCover` | `platform/shell/login-page.tsx` + a new cover component | Port split-screen shape; **fix the mobile-disappears-entirely gap** (§M/§3 pt. 9) as part of the port, not after |
| `hooks/useToast` (SweetAlert2-based) | *(to build)* a native toast system | **Do not port SweetAlert2.** It is a heavyweight, visually-foreign (non-Tailwind-token-driven, hardcoded hex colors) dependency for what should be a lightweight, theme-native toast. Build on a Radix-compatible toast primitive so it inherits the design-token system automatically instead of hardcoding light/dark hex pairs. Port only the *behavior* (position swap by direction, 3.2s timer, `confirm()` promise-based API shape) |
| `router/ProtectedRoute`, `NewspaperEnabledRoute` | TanStack Router's own guard mechanisms + New Admin's existing server-computed workspace-access model | Old Admin's permission model is client-declared (`permission?: string`); New Admin's is already server-authoritative (`useVisibleWorkspaces` intersects server response) — do not port the client-declarative pattern, it is architecturally weaker than what New Admin already has |

---

## 11. Components That Should Be Completely Redesigned

- **`Modal`** — hand-rolled, no Radix, unaudited focus-trap/ESC behavior. New Admin's Dialog is already Radix-based; this is a full replacement, not a visual port (§10).
- **`SwitchField`** — hand-rolled `<button role="switch">` with manual RTL thumb-translate math. Rebuild on `@radix-ui/react-switch`, which handles this correctly and for free.
- **`useToast`/SweetAlert2** — foreign visual language (hardcoded hex, not token-driven), heavyweight dependency for toast+confirm. Rebuild as a native, token-driven toast system; keep `confirm()`'s promise-based ergonomics but implement it on the Dialog primitive New Admin already has, not a second, unrelated modal system.
- **Breadcrumbs** — under-built (2-level-only in Old Admin); the new grouped IA (§8) needs a genuine multi-level trail, so this is a from-scratch build informed by, not copied from, Old Admin.
- **Settings navigation** — Old Admin's flat static list does not survive the Configuration Platform's real cardinality (§M5); needs search/discoverability designed in from the start, not retrofitted.
- **Required-field indication** — Old Admin has literally none (confirmed: no asterisk, no "(required)" text anywhere in any form field component). This should be designed properly in the new `TextField`/etc. base, not carried forward as an absence.

## 12. Components That Should Remain Almost Identical (Visual Language Only)

- **Button, Input, Avatar, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, Separator** — sound token-driven implementations already; port the visual tokens (radius, shadow, spacing) onto New Admin's existing, already-correct Radix-based equivalents.
- **DataTable's visual shell** (rounded-2xl bordered container, muted header row, hover tint, RTL-safe alignment) — the *engine* upgrades (TanStack Table), the *skin* ports directly.
- **AnalyticsKit's visual language** (square/bordered "data-density" surfaces distinct from soft-rounded "interactive" surfaces) — a genuinely good, deliberate distinction worth preserving exactly.
- **The `fade-in` keyframe and the calm, no-hover-scale motion language overall** (§4.4) — this is core to "the same feeling" the user asked for and should not be touched.
- **The sidebar's auto-open/longest-path-match/session-scoped-override interaction logic** (§8.4) — genuinely well-designed, port the algorithm as-is onto the new grouped data model.
- **The dashboard's "every widget self-contained, silently self-hides if unauthorized" philosophy** — already compatible with New Admin's `WidgetDefinition` registry with zero changes needed.

## 13. Components That Should Be Removed

- **SweetAlert2** as a dependency entirely (superseded per §11 — its visual language cannot be made token-driven without defeating the point of removing it).
- **The decorative Topbar search button** (§M1) — remove outright, replaced by the already-real `SearchBar`/Command Palette, never re-shipped as a placeholder.
- **The `NotificationsButton` stub's hardcoded-empty pattern** (§M2) — remove the fake affordance; New Admin's real, query-backed `NotificationCenter` replaces it directly, no interim stub needed since one already doesn't exist in New Admin.
- **Native `<select>`-based `SelectField`** — superseded by New Admin's already-built Radix-`Select`-based field; do not reintroduce the native-select pattern.
- **Client-declared route permission strings** (`ProtectedRoute permission="..."`) as the primary access-control mechanism — New Admin's server-computed `useVisibleWorkspaces` model is strictly better (§10) and should be the only pattern, not a parallel second one.

## 14. Components to Add for an Enterprise ERP (Not Present in Old Admin at All)

- **A real Detail/View template** distinct from Edit (§M8) — Old Admin never needed this because it never had a permission model this granular in practice; AlphaSchool's actual permission model (view vs. edit as genuinely separate grants, already core to the backend's `required_permission_to_view`/`required_permission_to_edit` pattern from ADR-0018) requires it.
- **A Wizard/multi-step form pattern** — nothing in Old Admin needed one; onboarding flows, guided setup (e.g. a first-time Provider credential setup walking through Vault write + health check), and complex multi-entity creation in an ERP context will.
- **A Timeline component** — Old Admin's ActivityLogPage gets close (expandable diff rows) but is table-shaped, not timeline-shaped; entity-level "everything that happened to this record" views (a natural Administration Experience Layer consumer, ADR-0021) want a real timeline.
- **A generic Health/Status badge + panel system**, promoted from `DiagnosticsPage`'s one-off `Row`/`Card`/`okBadge` helpers into `platform/components` — directly needed by Phase 2's `HealthCheckRunner` output (provider health results) and any future Configuration Health Engine (ADR-0021 Decision 6).
- **A Credential/Secret field family** that understands the Vault's specific shape (configured/not-configured state, "leave blank to keep," sensitivity marking per §Phase 2's own recorded future-consideration on credential sensitivity classification) — a superset of Old Admin's `SecretField`, purpose-built for the Provider Registry.
- **An approval-request UI pattern** — nothing in Old Admin needed one (it has no Approval Engine); AlphaSchool's backend has had one since Sprint 1.2 and it is now a live mechanism in both the Configuration Platform and Credential Vault write paths. A pending-approval banner/badge and an approve/reject action pattern are needed and have zero Old Admin precedent to draw from.
- **A risk-tiered confirmation system** (§M4, §M7, §3 pt. 4) as a first-class, named platform primitive — not an ad hoc per-page `confirm()` call.
- **A Command-Palette-indexed settings/configuration search** (§M5, §3 pt. 5) — no precedent in Old Admin.

## 15. Migration Strategy

This is a **rebuild of visual language on new bones**, not a migration of code. Sequencing, respecting the already-frozen extension-point discipline (ADR-0015 Decision 4 — no workspace addition may require editing `platform/`):

1. **Design tokens first** (§4) — update `admin/src/index.css`'s `@theme`/`:root`/`[data-theme='dark']` blocks with the brand palette, radius scale confirmation, shadow tokens, and font stack. Zero component code changes; every existing shell/shadcn-default component immediately re-skins for free, since they're already token-driven. This is the single highest-leverage, lowest-risk step, and should be done and visually verified in isolation before anything else.
2. **Shared component layer** (§6.3, §10 "to build" rows) — Badge, Skeleton, Textarea, Switch (Radix-based), PasswordField/SecretField, StickyActionBar, StatusPanel, KeyValueRow/InfoCard, IconBadgeButton, Pagination, SearchInput (list-scoped). Each is a small, independently-testable unit; build and visually verify against the token system from step 1.
3. **Navigation grouping extension** (§8.2) — the one genuine `WorkspaceDefinition` schema addition, additive and backward-compatible, unblocking the Administration group's IA before any real workspace is registered.
4. **Platform-level UX guarantees** (§9) — the unsaved-changes guard hook, the risk-tiered confirmation primitive, the universal success-toast mutation wrapper, the `aria-label`/logical-property lint rules. These belong in the platform layer precisely so no individual future workspace author can opt out by omission (§M3, §M6, §M7, §M10's root cause was always "left to per-page discretion").
5. **Page templates** (§7) as reusable layout components/hooks in `platform/`, proven against one real, low-stakes workspace first — the Administration workspace's own Configuration Platform / Provider Registry screens are the natural first real consumer, since their backend (Phases 0–2) is already frozen and live, and building their UI is explicitly named as deferred-not-abandoned work from the Phase 2 sign-off.
6. **Auth/first-impression polish** (§1.1, §3 pt. 9) — the mobile-safe brand cover fix, loading-shell refinement. Lower urgency than 1–5 since it affects a smaller fraction of total interaction time, but should not be deferred indefinitely given it's every new user's literal first impression.
7. **Everything else** — remaining workspaces (People, Identity, Academic, ...) are built per-workspace, each a self-contained consumer of the now-complete platform layer, in whatever order the backend Phase sequence and business priority dictate. No further `platform/` changes should be required for a normal workspace addition, per ADR-0015's own governing constraint.

Each step above should get its own real negative-case proof where one applies (e.g., the unsaved-changes guard should be proven by actually triggering a route change mid-edit and confirming the block fires, not merely code-reviewed) — the same discipline already standing for every backend phase in this project.

---

## 16. Risks

1. **RESOLVED — naming collision**: the draft flagged identical `Website` labels at two IA levels. Resolved per the frozen decision in §8.1: the Administration child is renamed **Digital Experience** (Branding, Login Experience, Domains, SEO, Analytics, Tracking, Social Presence, PWA, Public Identity); the top-level `Website` workspace keeps its scope unchanged (CMS, Pages, Menus, Rendering, Public Content).
2. **Token migration regressions**: because New Admin's current components are *already* fully token-driven (a real strength), a tokens-only pass (§15 step 1) carries low but non-zero risk of an un-anticipated visual break wherever a component hardcodes a color/radius instead of using the token (worth a quick audit pass before declaring step 1 complete).
3. **SweetAlert2 removal is a real behavior change, not just a re-skin** — its `confirm()` is used in several places already (§10); removing it requires re-wiring every call site, not just restyling. This should be scoped and sequenced deliberately, not treated as equivalent effort to a pure CSS token swap.
4. **The grouping extension (§8.2) is the one place this document proposes touching an already-frozen extension point** (`WorkspaceDefinition`). It is designed to be additive and non-breaking, matching the same discipline already used twice in the backend (Phase 1/2's own additive fixes to frozen scaffolds) — but it should go through the same "smallest possible documented decision" review this project applies to every such change, not be treated as pre-approved by this document alone.
5. **Font licensing/hosting**: Tajawal + Inter via Google Fonts CDN (Old Admin's current method) is a network dependency and a minor privacy/offline consideration for an ERP that may run in restricted environments — flagged as an open question in §4.2, not resolved here.
6. **Scope creep risk on §14's "Enterprise ERP additions"** — several of these (Wizard, Timeline, Approval UI) are genuinely substantial components, not small ports. They should be built against real, specific consumers (the way `BilingualNameField` was clearly built against this ERP's actual bilingual data model) rather than speculatively, matching the whole project's B1 promotion-not-prediction discipline.

## 17. Technical Debt Inherited From Old Admin

(Findings that should inform what *not* to copy, distinct from UX mistakes users would notice — these are code-quality/maintainability observations.)

1. **The "0 radius everywhere" Tailwind config is dead policy** — actively contradicted by the majority of real components (§4.3). A design system document should never let a config lie about what the product actually looks like; the new tokens file must be honest about the real, intended radius scale from day one.
2. **Duplicated sticky-save-bar markup** (§M6) — copy-pasted, not componentized, between `UserFormPage.tsx` and `SaveBar.tsx`.
3. **Duplicated unread-badge markup** between `ChatButton.tsx` and `ContactButton.tsx` — identical class strings, not extracted.
4. **`DiagnosticsPage`'s `Row`/`Card` helpers are page-scoped**, not shared, despite the same visual shape recurring across multiple administrative pages.
5. **SweetAlert2's hardcoded hex colors** (`#162130`/`#e5edf5` dark, `#ffffff`/`#1f2a37` light) mean the toast system does not actually track the HSL token system the rest of the app is built on — a real, if minor, design-system leak.
6. **No test coverage evidenced** for any UI component (no `*.test.tsx` files found alongside any reviewed component, no Storybook) — New Admin already has Vitest + Testing Library wired (`vitest.config.ts`, `@testing-library/react` in `devDependencies`) and should hold every new shared component to that bar from the start, unlike Old Admin.
7. **Client-declared permission strings at the route level** (`ProtectedRoute permission="..."`) sit alongside a *separate*, more authoritative server-computed check pattern used elsewhere (nav-level `hasPermission`) — two parallel permission-declaration mechanisms in one codebase is itself a maintainability smell, resolved architecturally in New Admin already (§10's last row) but worth naming so it's never reintroduced.

## 18. Final Recommendations Before Implementation

1. **Do tokens first, alone, and verify visually before anything else** (§15 step 1) — the highest-leverage, lowest-risk, most immediately-gratifying step, and the one most likely to produce the "I recognize this" feeling the user asked for on day one.
2. ~~Resolve the `Website`/`Administration > Website` naming collision as an explicit product decision before the navigation spec (§8) is implemented.~~ **RESOLVED** — see §8.1 (Administration's child renamed Digital Experience).
3. **Treat §9 (UX Specification) as the actual acceptance checklist** for every new component and page going forward — it is the concrete, checkable form of "familiar in the first five minutes, better after five minutes."
4. **Do not port SweetAlert2, the hand-rolled Modal, or the hand-rolled Switch** under any circumstance, even temporarily "to move faster" — New Admin already has strictly better primitives available (Radix Dialog/Switch) and reintroducing the old ones would be a genuine regression, not a neutral shortcut.
5. **Build the Administration workspace's own screens (Configuration Platform, Provider Registry) as the first real proof of every pattern in this document** — its backend is already frozen and live (Phases 0–2), its UI was explicitly deferred rather than abandoned at Phase 2 sign-off, and it is the workspace best positioned to validate the grouping extension (§8.2), the Credential/Secret field family (§14), and the risk-tiered confirmation system (§14) all at once, against real, already-working APIs rather than mocked ones.
6. ~~This document is not an ADR and does not freeze anything on its own — it awaits explicit review and approval before any of §15's implementation steps begin.~~ **Superseded by §22 — the document is now frozen.**

## 19. Iconography System (Frozen Decision)

### 19.1 Evaluation

Three candidates evaluated against the ten criteria requested, all as React packages (`lucide-react`, `@tabler/icons-react`, `@heroicons/react`):

| Criterion | Lucide | Tabler | Heroicons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Enterprise ERP usage** | Strong — de facto standard in the shadcn/Radix ecosystem this stack is already built on; widely proven at dashboard/admin scale | Strong — Tabler itself began as an admin-dashboard kit, so ERP-adjacent icon coverage (devices, business, finance, transport) is deep | Weak at ERP scale — designed as a focused UI-chrome set for marketing/product sites, not a full application icon vocabulary |
| **Long-term consistency** | High — a smaller, tightly curated ~1,500-icon set with a single, disciplined 24×24/2px-stroke/round-cap grid enforced across the whole library | Medium-high — a much larger ~5,700-icon set built by many contributors over a longer history; overall consistent, but minor stroke/corner-radius drift is more likely to creep in across such a large surface | High — a very small, hand-polished ~300-icon set; consistency is easy to maintain precisely because the set stays small |
| **Outline quality** | Excellent — clean geometric outline style, deliberately restrained | Excellent — comparable outline quality, slightly more literal/detailed in some icons | Excellent, arguably the most refined per-icon, but on too small a set to matter at ERP scale |
| **RTL appearance** | Neutral — no RTL-specific variants in any of the three; all rely on the consuming app's own `rtl:rotate-180`/logical-property handling for directional icons (arrows, chevrons). Old Admin already solved this correctly *for Lucide specifically* — continuing with Lucide means zero re-verification of already-proven RTL behavior | Neutral, same caveat, but every directional icon's RTL behavior would need re-verifying from a cold start | Neutral, same caveat, and the smallest directional-icon set to re-verify |
| **Dashboard readability** | Strong at 20–24px — icons stay legible and geometrically clean at typical KPI/widget sizes | Strong, comparable | Strong, comparable, but limited coverage forces mixing icon styles once the dashboard needs a concept Heroicons doesn't have |
| **Dense data tables** | Strong at 16px — stroke weight holds up without looking like a smudge at the smallest common UI size | Strong, comparable | Comparable at 16px, same coverage caveat |
| **Navigation** | Strong — very complete coverage of generic nav/module concepts (already proven across Old Admin's entire 13-section nav tree, which is 100% Lucide today) | Strong, comparable coverage, but zero continuity with what Old Admin's users already recognize | Insufficient — would run out of icons for a nav tree this large (Old Admin's nav alone uses ~50 distinct icons; Heroicons' full outline set is ~300, and ERP-specific concepts like "gradebook" or "bus route" are not guaranteed to exist) |
| **Forms** | Strong — full coverage of form-adjacent icons (eye/eye-off, calendar, upload, link, checkmark states) | Strong, comparable | Strong for the common cases, thin for anything specific |
| **Settings/Administration** | Strong — sliders, plug, cloud, shield, key, server, database, webhook-shaped icons all present and already in active use in Old Admin's own Administration-adjacent nav | Strong, comparable, larger raw count | Thin — Heroicons' scope was never meant to cover a Provider Registry / Credential Vault / diagnostics-panel vocabulary this specific |
| **Accessibility** | Equal — icon libraries do not themselves provide accessibility; each ships plain SVG with no baked-in `aria-hidden`/`role`, meaning the same discipline (§9: every icon-only control gets an explicit `aria-label` on its interactive parent) applies identically regardless of which library is chosen | Equal | Equal |
| **Future scalability** | Very strong — ~1,500 icons today, actively and frequently released, more than sufficient for every domain this ERP's own Blueprint enumerates (Academic, Admissions, Finance, HR, Inventory, Library, Transportation, LMS, Reporting, Identity, Media, Notifications, and all nine Administration capabilities) with real headroom | Strongest in raw count (~5,700) but that headroom is never actually needed at the scale a navigation/action icon vocabulary reaches in practice (typically low hundreds of distinct icons even in a large ERP) | Weakest — ~300 icons will not comfortably cover this product's full domain vocabulary without a second library, which directly violates the "one library, no exceptions" requirement |

### 19.2 Decision

**Lucide Icons (`lucide-react`) is the official AlphaSchool Design System icon library. No other icon library, and no raw/custom SVGs outside this set, may be used anywhere in the ERP frontend.**

Reasoning, beyond the table above:

1. **Lucide is already the icon library in both codebases.** `lucide-react` is a dependency of Old Admin (`^0.454.0`) *and* New Admin (`^1.24.0`) today. Every icon shape a returning user already recognizes — the exact `Settings` gear, the exact `Users` glyph, the exact `ShieldCheck` — is already Lucide. Switching to Tabler or Heroicons would mean the *style* might feel similar but literally none of the specific icon shapes would be the ones users already know, directly undermining the whole project's "same feeling" mandate. This is the single most decisive factor and is not present in the same way for either alternative.
2. **Consistency at the scale this product actually needs beats raw count.** Tabler's larger set is a real asset for icon-picker-style features with thousands of choices; it is not an asset for a navigation/action vocabulary that, even across this ERP's full 15+ domain modules, will land in the low-to-mid hundreds of distinct icons — comfortably inside Lucide's coverage, with less stylistic variance risk than a 5,700-icon multi-contributor set.
3. **Ecosystem fit.** New Admin's stack (Radix primitives, `cva`, shadcn-shaped conventions) treats Lucide as its default icon assumption; any future shadcn-ecosystem recipe or component adopted wholesale will already assume Lucide-shaped icon usage.
4. **Outline-by-default matches the "no filled icons" policy precisely.** Lucide's core set is outline-only; filled variants exist only as explicitly separate, individually-opted-into icons (e.g. a small number of `*-Filled`-style exceptions), which is the correct shape for a "filled is the rare, deliberate exception" policy. Tabler ships a full parallel filled set for most icons by default, a larger standing temptation for filled-icon creep across a large team over time.

### 19.3 Sizing Scale (Frozen)

All sizes as the icon's own bounding box (Tailwind `size-*`/`h-* w-*`), independent of any surrounding hit-target padding:

| Context | Size | Tailwind | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Table / dense data** | 16px | `size-4` | Inline table-cell icons, compact row actions — the smallest size in the system, never go smaller |
| **Button (default)** | 16px | `size-4` | Matches New Admin's already-established `Button` cva convention (`[&_svg]:size-4`) — no change needed |
| **Button (large/primary CTA)** | 20px | `size-5` | Reserved for `size="lg"` buttons only |
| **Form fields** (inline field icons — password toggle, search icon inset, upload icon) | 16px | `size-4` | Matches button/table density |
| **Toolbar / Topbar action icons** (search, theme toggle, notifications, user-menu chevron) | 20px | `size-5` | Rendered inside a 36–40px hit target (`h-9`/`h-10` icon button), per accessible touch-target guidance — the icon is smaller than its clickable area, never the reverse |
| **Sidebar navigation** (both collapsed rail and expanded label state) | 20px | `size-5` | One size regardless of collapsed state, per Old Admin's own precedent (`Sidebar.tsx`'s consistent `h-5 w-5`) — the icon must not visually resize when the label appears/disappears |
| **Dashboard / KPI / widget icons** | 20px | `size-5` | Rendered inside a 40px colored badge square (`h-10 w-10`), matching Old Admin's `MetricCard`/section-`Panel` icon-badge pattern exactly |
| **Status panels** (Loading/Error/Empty state) | 24px | `size-6` | Rendered inside a larger 56px badge (`h-14 w-14`), the one place a bigger icon is warranted since it is the primary content of an otherwise-empty view |

### 19.4 Stroke Width (Frozen)

**2px stroke width, uniformly, at every size in §19.3 — Lucide's own default, unmodified.** No per-size stroke tuning. A thinner stroke (e.g. 1.5) at 16px reads as weak/blurry at that size, and stroke-width tuning by context is a maintenance burden with no real visual payoff for an interface at this density. The one narrow, named exception: a purely decorative/illustrative icon larger than 32px (if one is ever introduced, e.g. an auth-page illustration accent) may use 1.5 for a lighter, less clinical feel — this is an explicit, rare exception, never a second general rule.

### 19.5 States (Frozen)

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Default (inactive)** | `text-muted-foreground` — matches Old Admin's inactive-nav-icon convention exactly |
| **Hover** | `text-foreground` (or `text-accent-foreground` inside an already-`hover:bg-accent` interactive surface), via `transition-colors` — never a scale/translate hover effect, per §4.4's calm-motion rule |
| **Active / selected** (current nav item, toggled-on state) | `text-primary` |
| **Disabled** | Inherits the parent control's `disabled:opacity-50` (already the standing convention on `Button`'s own cva) — never a separate icon-level disabled treatment, and never a different disabled color, only reduced opacity |
| **Focus** | Icons never receive their own focus ring — the parent interactive element's existing `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring` treatment (§9) is sufficient and correct; adding a second, icon-level focus style would be a redundant, inconsistent-looking double ring |

### 19.6 No filled icons — the policy, precisely

Outline icons only, everywhere, with exactly one narrow exception class: a small unread/status **dot** or **badge** (already an established pattern — Old Admin's chat/contact unread badge, §10's `IconBadgeButton`) is not an "icon" in this policy's sense and may remain a solid-filled shape, since it is functioning as a notification indicator, not as a glyph representing a concept. Any future request to use a filled *icon* (as opposed to a filled *indicator dot*) requires an explicit, named, strong reason recorded at the point of use — the default, unstated assumption is always outline.

---

## 20. Login Experience (Frozen Decision)

The login page is a first-class Design System surface, not an authentication afterthought — it is the single highest-leverage moment for the "same feeling, better experience" mandate (§0), since it is the one screen every user, on every device, sees before anything else.

### 20.1 Structure

Retains Old Admin's split-screen shape (§7 Auth Template, §10) as the base composition — a brand column and a form column — but fixes its one confirmed failure (§1.1, §3 pt. 9: the brand column fully disappearing below `lg`) and extends it into a genuinely configurable, premium entry experience:

- **Desktop/tablet (`≥lg`)**: two-column split, brand column first (start side, respecting RTL), form column second, matching Old Admin's proportions.
- **Mobile (`<lg`)**: the brand column does **not** disappear. It collapses into a compact header band — solid brand-color strip (or a cropped slice of the configured background image, never a full illustration crush) containing the school logo and, space permitting, the rotating welcome title — above a full-width centered form. This is the concrete fix for the confirmed mobile identity loss.
- The brand column's content is layered, in this priority order, so lower layers gracefully degrade if a higher one isn't configured: **background layer** (image, slider, or video — §20.3) → **overlay** (Old Admin's radial-gradient scrim, kept, for text legibility over any background) → **content** (logo, welcome title/description, rotating motivational message, version/copyright footer).

### 20.2 School logo — sourced from the Configuration Platform

The logo is never a hardcoded asset. It resolves through the already-built Configuration Platform (`SettingsResolver`, ADR-0018) exactly as Identity's OTP settings already do (Phase 1's own proof consumer) — a `DeclaresSettingsSchema` entry (owning module: the new Digital Experience capability, §8.1) declaring a Configuration key (e.g. `digital-experience.branding.logo_media_id`, `translatable_category` not applicable — a media reference, not text) whose resolved value is a Media reference (the already-frozen Media Architecture, `docs/DOMAIN_BLUEPRINT.md` §12) rather than a raw URL. This gives the login page automatic light/dark logo variants for free if the Configuration schema declares two keys (`logo_light_media_id` / `logo_dark_media_id`) rather than one, exactly the kind of small, explicit metadata decision this Configuration model already supports.

A logo that fails to resolve (not yet configured, e.g. immediately after installation — see §21.2) falls back to the AlphaSchool product wordmark, never a broken image or empty space.

### 20.3 Background — image, slider, or video (mutually exclusive, Configuration-driven)

Three modes, selected by a single Configuration key (`digital-experience.branding.login_background_mode`: `image` | `slider` | `video` | `none`), each with its own Configuration-backed asset reference(s) (again, Media references, not raw URLs):

- **`image`** — one static background image, object-fit cover, behind the existing gradient overlay.
- **`slider`** — an ordered set of images (a `requires`-declared array of Media references), auto-advancing on a fixed interval (recommend 8s, matching a "calm, not attention-grabbing" motion posture consistent with §4.4), with `prefers-reduced-motion` respected (§20.7) by freezing on the first image rather than disabling the feature outright.
- **`video`** — a short, muted, looping background video (autoplay requires muted per browser policy; never autoplay with sound), with the static `image` mode's asset used as the `poster`/fallback for slow connections and for `prefers-reduced-motion` users (video does not autoplay for that group — falls back to the poster image, motion-safe by construction).
- **`none`** — solid `--primary` background only (Old Admin's actual current behavior), always a valid, complete configuration on its own — background media is enhancement, never a requirement.

### 20.4 Welcome content — multilingual, Configuration-driven, with a safe default

Welcome title and description are Configuration keys using the Configuration Platform's own bilingual `Translatable` convention (Blueprint Addendum B5 — the same three-way translation test already governing every other bilingual field in this system, not a bespoke i18n-only string), so a school can customize its own welcome copy per language without a deploy. Un-configured, both fall back to a sensible product default (i18n keys, not empty strings) — the page is never blank pending a school's own copy.

**Rotating motivational messages** are a small, ordered array (Configuration-backed, bilingual) cross-fading on a calm interval (recommend 6–8s, the same `fade-in` keyframe already frozen in §4.4, never a slide/wipe transition) beneath the main welcome title — an enhancement layer, empty array is a fully valid, complete state (the title/description alone suffice).

### 20.5 Maintenance mode message

Old Admin's `maintenance_mode` toggle (flagged in §M4 as needing risk-tiered confirmation on the *admin* side) has a direct, necessary counterpart on the *login* side: when the resolved Configuration state is maintenance-on, the login page replaces the standard welcome content with a clear, distinct maintenance notice (not a generic error) — explaining the system is temporarily unavailable, without exposing internal diagnostic detail (no stack traces, no environment info — that belongs solely in the authenticated Diagnostics page, §1.4). Authentication itself is not blocked by maintenance mode for accounts holding the elevated permission that can toggle it off (mirroring Old Admin's own `NewspaperEnabledRoute` precedent of always leaving the door open for the person who can turn a flag back on) — everyone else sees the notice in place of the login form.

### 20.6 Version footer & copyright

A small, permanently-visible footer inside the brand column: app version (build-time-injected, never hand-maintained), and a copyright line using the same bilingual Configuration-backed pattern as Old Admin's `copyright_text_ar`/`copyright_text_en` fields (§1.3) — ported as a genuine Configuration Platform key this time, not a legacy dual-field settings-form artifact.

### 20.7 Accessibility

- The background layer (image/slider/video) is `aria-hidden` and purely decorative — screen readers never announce it, and its cross-fade/rotation never steals focus.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` freezes the slider on its first frame and suppresses the video background entirely (falls to the poster image) and disables the motivational-message cross-fade (shows the first message statically) — every motion enhancement in this experience has a named, correct reduced-motion fallback, not just the ones convenient to handle.
- Full keyboard operability of the form column exactly as specified in §1.6/§9 (focus-visible rings, no keyboard traps, logical tab order starting in the form, never requiring a user to tab through decorative brand-column content first).
- Sufficient contrast between the gradient overlay and any welcome text is a hard requirement of the overlay's own default styling, not left to a school's background-image choice to accidentally violate — the overlay must guarantee WCAG AA contrast for overlaid text regardless of the underlying image's own colors.

### 20.8 Responsive layout

Specified in full in §20.1; the concrete, testable acceptance criterion is: **no viewport width ever loses the school's brand identity entirely** — the confirmed Old Admin failure this section exists to fix.

### 20.9 Post-authentication flow — Loading Experience → Workspace Bootstrap → Dashboard

This flow is itself a frozen Design System sequence, not an implementation detail:

1. **Loading Experience** — immediately on successful credential submission, the form column transitions (via the existing `fade-in` keyframe, never a jarring cut) to a branded loading state — the school logo (already resolved and cached from the login page itself, zero additional flash) with a calm, indeterminate progress indicator. This replaces Old Admin's generic, unbranded centered `LoadingState` (§1.1's confirmed gap: "no skeleton of the eventual layout") with something that still carries brand identity through the transition.
2. **Workspace Bootstrap** — the moment `/api/v1/me` and `/api/v1/workspaces` resolve (New Admin's existing, already-built endpoints), the loading experience's copy updates to reflect what's actually happening (a "setting up your workspace" class of message, not a spinner with no context) while `useVisibleWorkspaces` computes the user's actual permitted set — this is the natural, already-existing seam in New Admin's architecture (§8) where this step belongs; no new backend mechanism is required.
3. **Dashboard** — the resolved workspace set renders, and if it is empty, New Admin's already-built `EmptyWorkspaceState` (§1.1 — a component Old Admin never needed to build) takes over immediately, never a blank page.

Every transition in this three-step sequence uses the same `fade-in` keyframe (§4.4) — the whole first-impression journey, from login through to a populated dashboard, should read as one continuous, calm, branded experience, not three visually disconnected screens.

## 21. Installer Experience (Documented, Not Implemented)

Two genuinely different experiences, explicitly separated per instruction. Neither is implemented by this document — this section exists so the distinction is decided and recorded before either is ever built.

### 21.1 Installation Wizard

**Audience.** A technical operator (DevOps, a systems integrator, AlphaSchool's own deployment engineer) provisioning a brand-new dedicated instance (this ERP's confirmed commercial model — dedicated-instance-per-customer, ADR-0006). Not a school administrator, not a teacher, never a student-facing surface.

**Purpose.** Get the application from "code deployed, nothing configured" to "a working, empty, securely-provisioned instance ready to hand off." This is infrastructure bring-up, not business configuration.

**Scope (indicative, not final — a future dedicated design pass owns the real specification):**
- Environment/database connectivity verification (mirroring Diagnostics' own `connectivity.database`/`connectivity.cache` checks, §1.4 — the same health-check vocabulary, reused rather than reinvented).
- Application key / encryption key generation (the same mechanism the Credential Vault's `encrypted:array` cast already depends on, Phase 2).
- Initial migration run.
- Creation of exactly one initial super-admin account (the same `is_super_admin` `Gate::before` bypass mechanism already frozen in the backend, `DOMAIN_BLUEPRINT.md` §8) — deliberately minimal, a login credential only, no school identity yet.
- Storage tier / disk driver confirmation (Media Architecture's three-tier disk model, `docs/DOMAIN_BLUEPRINT.md` §12) and, where applicable, initial Provider Registry credentials for storage (R2StorageProvider, Phase 2) — this is the one place the Installation Wizard and the Provider Registry backend genuinely intersect.

**Visual treatment.** Minimal, functional, safe — closer to a command-line-adjacent setup flow than a branded consumer experience. It should not attempt Digital Experience branding at all (§8.1/§20), since at this point in the lifecycle no school identity, logo, or Configuration values exist yet to brand it *with* — using placeholder/generic AlphaSchool product branding only, explicitly not the eventual school's own identity.

**Never confuse with**: the First-Time School Setup Wizard below. A technical operator running this wizard is not necessarily the same person, role, or even organization as the school staff who will later configure the school's own identity — conflating the two would force a DevOps engineer through school-branding questions they cannot answer, and force a school administrator through database-connectivity questions they should never have to see.

### 21.2 First-Time School Setup Wizard

**Audience.** The school's own super-admin, immediately after the Installation Wizard hands off a working-but-empty instance, or at any later point an operator chooses to (re-)run guided setup.

**Purpose.** Turn an empty, generic instance into *this specific school's* branded, structurally-ready ERP. This is business/pedagogical configuration, not infrastructure.

**Scope (indicative, not final):**
- **School identity** — name (bilingual), logo (light/dark, feeding directly into §20.2's Configuration keys — this wizard is the natural *authoring* surface for the values the Login Experience *consumes*), primary brand color (the `--primary` token override, §4.1's own "organization brand-color slot," ADR-0006), the Digital Experience capability's own Configuration keys (§8.1: Branding, Login Experience, Domains, SEO, Social Presence).
- **Branch setup** — at least one initial Branch (the multi-branch primitive this entire ERP's permission/Configuration-altitude model already assumes, ADR-0018 Decision 4's Global→Branch chain).
- **Academic structure bootstrap** — initial academic year/term, if the Academic module is licensed for this instance (Workspace licensing, `docs/ADMIN_PLATFORM.md`'s own "Organization-level licensing determines which workspaces are even possible").
- **Initial roles/permissions provisioning** — beyond the one bare super-admin account the Installation Wizard created, guided creation of the school's real initial staff accounts and role assignments (Permission Groups, `DOMAIN_BLUEPRINT.md` §8).
- **Provider/Integration onboarding** — a guided, low-pressure on-ramp into the Provider Registry (Phase 2) for the integrations a school is likely to want immediately (email/SMTP at minimum, matching Phase 2's own SMTP proof provider) — framed as "connect your email" business language, never exposing Vault/credential-field internals directly.

**Visual treatment.** This *is* a Design System surface — full Digital Experience branding is deliberately unavailable at the start of this wizard (nothing is configured yet) but the wizard itself uses the standard AlphaSchool product identity (§4) and is the natural first real implementation of the **Wizard/multi-step form pattern** already named as a required Enterprise addition (§14) — guided, step-indicator-driven, save-progress-and-resume-capable (a school administrator should never have to complete this in one sitting), each step a genuine `SettingsSection`-shaped card (§7 Settings/Configuration Template) rather than a generic unstyled form.

**Never confuse with**: the Installation Wizard above. This wizard assumes a working, secure, already-provisioned instance and a logged-in super-admin — it has no business ever asking about database connectivity, encryption keys, or storage drivers.

**Explicitly out of scope for this document**: field-level specification, exact step sequencing, and screen-by-screen layout for either wizard. Per instruction, this section documents that the two experiences exist, are distinct, and roughly what each owns — a dedicated design pass (following this same evidence-based discipline) is the correct venue for the full specification, at the point either is actually scheduled for implementation.

---

## 22. Document Freeze Declaration

**This document is now FROZEN as of this revision.** Per explicit approval: the document approved in principle in its draft form, plus the three decisions recorded in §8.1 (navigation naming), §19 (iconography system), and §20 (login experience), plus the documented-not-implemented Installer Experience split (§21), together constitute the **official AlphaSchool ERP Administration Frontend Design System**.

Consistent with this project's standing discipline for every frozen document: no further design discussion is expected or warranted unless implementation exposes a genuine usability problem — at which point the resolution follows the same rule already proven repeatedly across the backend (Phase 1's deptrac gap, `PermissionDoesNotExist`, `model_has_roles.branch_id`; Phase 2's `ProviderSlotDefinition` permission fields, `MailFake::raw()`) — the smallest possible documented amendment, appended here, never a reopened redesign discussion.

**Explicit instruction carried forward into implementation**: do not imitate Old Admin pixel-by-pixel. Every component mapping in §10, every "keep almost identical" entry in §12, and every token in §4 exists to preserve *identity and feeling*, not to reproduce Old Admin's exact markup, exact class strings, or its own internal inconsistencies (§4.3's dead radius-0 policy chief among them). Where this document identifies a gap between what Old Admin *did* and what it *should have done* (§2's ten UX mistakes, §3's Experience Improvements, §17's technical debt), AlphaSchool ERP implements the improvement, not the inherited flaw — "familiar in the first five minutes, noticeably better after five" (§0) is the acceptance bar for every screen built against this document, not merely "looks the same."

Implementation begins per the sequencing in §15, starting with design tokens alone (§15 step 1), now including the frozen icon library (§19) and informed by the frozen Login Experience specification (§20) as the natural first real proof of the full token system working end-to-end on a single, self-contained, high-visibility page.

---

## 23. Phase B Revision — Icon Sizing & Radius Amendment (2026-07-19)

Per §22's own stated amendment trigger ("implementation exposes a genuine usability problem"), two smallest-possible amendments to the frozen §4.3 and §19.3, both raised during real App Shell (Phase B) implementation review, not a reopened redesign discussion.

### 23.1 Icon Sizing — supersedes §19.3

**Problem.** §19.3's scale was tuned for density, not for AlphaSchool ERP's actual primary users — school principals, administrative staff, finance/HR employees, and teachers, many spending 6–8 hours/day in the system, a meaningful share older users wearing corrective lenses. Readability and recognition speed outrank compactness for this audience.

**New scale**, replacing §19.3's table (defined in `admin/src/lib/icon-sizes.ts` as the single source of truth — `ICON_SIZE.dense` / `.default` / `.prominent` — never a raw `size-*` class on a semantic icon):

| Tier | Size | Tailwind | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dense** | 20px | `size-5` | Table/dense-data cells, inline row actions, toolbar buttons, user-menu items, form-field icons |
| **Default** | 24px | `size-6` | Sidebar nav, topbar actions (search, command palette, notifications, theme/language), primary buttons |
| **Prominent** | 28px | `size-7` | Status panels (Loading/Error/Empty state), dashboard/KPI card icons |

Click targets and spacing were re-verified after the increase (Phase B revision browser pass, 2026-07-19): icon buttons hold at a 40px (`size-10`) hit target, inputs at `h-10`, avatar at `size-9` — all comfortably above the icon's own bounding box at every tier, so the larger icons did not force a corresponding hit-target increase.

**Real bug found and fixed in the same pass, not merely a size change**: `[&_svg]:size-4`-style descendant rules on `Button` and `DropdownMenuItem` have *higher* CSS specificity than a plain `size-*` class on the icon element itself, silently overriding any component-level icon explicitly sized per this scale. Both now use the `[&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-N` guard — a default for icons that don't specify a size, never an override for ones that do. Any future component following the same descendant-default pattern must use the same guard.

Small status/count indicators (unread badges, unread dots, breadcrumb chevron separators) are deliberately outside this scale, unchanged — they are not primary icons and were never governed by §19.3.

### 23.2 Radius — supersedes §4.3's radius paragraph and its `--radius`/`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl` calc-derived scale

**Problem.** §4.3's adopted scale (10px base, `calc()`-derived tiers up to `--radius-xl` ≈ 14px, with several App Shell components independently reaching for Tailwind's own `rounded-2xl`/`rounded-3xl` defaults on top of that) reads as softer and more consumer-oriented than the "professional, stable, enterprise-grade, information-focused" surface this product should present.

**New scale** (`admin/src/index.css`'s `@theme` block, four independent flat tokens, none derived from the others):

| Token | Value | Tailwind utility |
|---|---|---|
| `--radius-none` | 0px | `rounded-none` |
| `--radius-sm` | 4px | `rounded-sm` |
| `--radius-md` | 6px | `rounded-md` |
| `--radius-lg` | 8px | `rounded-lg` |

`rounded-lg` (8px) is the ceiling — no `xl`/`2xl`/`3xl` tier is defined, and every component previously using one was remapped to a tier above. `rounded-full` remains available, unchanged, for genuinely circular elements (Avatar, unread-count badge, unread dot, Badge, user-menu trigger) — a separate design-language decision, not an exception carved into this scale.

Per-surface application, superseding any conflicting radius choice made during initial Phase B implementation:

| Surface | Tier |
|---|---|
| Sidebar (outer panel) | none |
| Navigation items (sidebar links, group headers, collapse toggle) | `sm` |
| Tables, page containers | none |
| Cards, dashboard widgets | `sm`–`md` (4–6px, never more) |
| Dropdowns, popovers, tooltips, skeleton placeholders | `md` |
| Dialogs, the Command Palette | `lg` (the enterprise ceiling — "moderate," never larger) |
| Buttons, inputs, selects | `md` (already-correct, unchanged) |

### 23.3 Status

Both amendments are implemented and browser-verified (real login, LTR/RTL, light theme) against the running App Shell as of 2026-07-19. This section, together with §19.3 and §4.3's radius paragraph (left in place for historical record of the original reasoning, now superseded by §23.1/§23.2), is the complete, current statement of these two token systems. No further icon-sizing or radius discussion is expected unless implementation exposes a new, genuine usability problem — the same standing rule as §22.

---

## 24. Global Context Model — Organization, Branch, Academic Year (Frozen 2026-07-19)

A new append-only addition, not a supersession — no prior section of this document specified a Global Context concept. Reached through a dedicated UX review (not implemented in code as of this freeze; see §24.8) that deliberately challenged the original proposal before converging here.

### 24.1 Model

Organization, Branch, and Academic Year are **Global Application Context**, not page-level filters. A user navigating between Students, Attendance, Grades, Timetable, and Finance stays inside the same working context across all of them without re-specifying it per screen — both what they see by default, and what a newly-created record targets by default (a new attendance entry, a new grade, a new timetable slot all need an implicit "which year" without asking every time).

### 24.2 Context Control

A single, unified Context control lives in the Topbar — e.g. "AlphaSchool Amman • Main Branch • 2025–2026" — opening one panel to adjust any of the three, rather than three independent dropdowns competing for space. One mental model ("where am I right now"), and it scales cleanly if a future context dimension is ever added. Organization and Branch are scope axes; Academic Year is the only time axis among the three, which is why §24.3–§24.5 apply to Year specifically and not to Organization/Branch switching.

### 24.3 Switching Behavior

Selecting a different Academic Year inside the Context Panel does not apply instantly. It surfaces a lightweight, explicit **Switch** step inline within the same panel — never a separate modal, never a blocking popup:

```
Switch Context
Current:  2025–2026
          ↓
          2024–2025
[Cancel]  [Switch]
```

This is deliberately proportioned: heavier than a plain filter (correct — Global Context recontextualizes every open workspace and tab at once, which is a genuine disorientation risk even though it carries no data risk on its own), lighter than a blocking confirmation dialog (correct — browsing a past year is safe by construction; see §24.5 for where real protection actually lives).

### 24.4 Working vs. System Active Academic Year

Whenever the selected (Working) Academic Year differs from the system's actual current (Active) year, the Topbar always shows both, distinctly, using calm/muted styling — never `--warning`/`--destructive`. A user must never be able to look at the shell and mistake a historical Working Year for the system's actual current year, whether because they switched it themselves earlier in the session or because they're looking at a colleague's screen. Exact layout (stacked two-line label vs. a "Viewing Historical Year" caption) is an implementation-time visual decision, not a UX-model constraint.

### 24.5 Write Boundary Protection

Protection lives at the point of mutation, not at the Context Switch — this is the central UX principle of this section. Browsing a historical Academic Year is always low-friction and safe; a create/update/delete targeting a non-active year is where real protection applies:

1. **Permission gate** — a distinct `modify-historical-records` permission, separate from `view-historical-records`, reusing the view/edit permission-split convention already frozen elsewhere (ADR-0018 Decision 9). Without it, the mutating control is disabled with an explanatory tooltip, never shown-then-warned.
2. **Risk-tiered confirmation** — reusing the existing risk taxonomy (reversible / destructive / high-blast-radius, §M4/§M7/§M9) rather than one generic "this is historical" dialog regardless of the mutation's actual size or reversibility.
3. **Approval routing for the top tier** — through the already-built Approval Engine, with a mandatory recorded reason, exactly how every other high-blast-radius action in this system already works. No bespoke, weaker, frontend-only mechanism invented specifically for Academic Year.

### 24.6 Persistence

Global Context (Organization, Branch, and Academic Year together, as one unit) persists via the same mechanism already established elsewhere in the App Shell (Zustand + `persist`, matching `sidenav-store.ts`'s pattern) for the duration of the authenticated session — page reloads and additional tabs under the same login retain the selection. **On every fresh login, Global Context resets to system defaults** (the user's default/primary Branch, the system's current Academic Year), never restored from a prior session's selection.

This is a first-principles decision, not a port of an existing Branch-context policy — none exists. A dedicated codebase check (2026-07-19) confirmed the Admin Platform Foundation has no branch-switcher concept today: permissions are computed as a union across all of a user's branches specifically because no "current branch" exists yet (`User.php`'s own docblock states this explicitly), no backend endpoint returns a current branch/team, and no frontend store holds one. Global Context is therefore the first implementation of this concept for all three dimensions together — reset-on-login was chosen specifically because it closes the same "stale historical context silently surviving into a new session" risk that §24.5's write-boundary protection exists to guard against, at zero practical cost (most logins default to the current Branch and current Year regardless).

### 24.7 Branch / Academic Year Validity

The application must never sit in an invalid Branch/Academic Year pairing. If a Branch switch leaves the currently-selected Academic Year unavailable for the new Branch, the system automatically corrects to that Branch's active Academic Year — immediately, without a blocking dialog (this is a system-initiated validity correction, not a deliberate user switch, so §24.3's explicit-switch friction does not apply) — and surfaces a brief, non-blocking inline notice in the Context Panel (e.g. "Academic Year switched to 2025–2026 — not available for [Branch Name]"), so the correction is always visible, never silent.

### 24.8 Status

This section is a frozen **design decision**, not yet implemented in code — no Global Context control, store, or write-boundary guard exists in `admin/` as of this freeze. It is ready to be picked up as its own implementation slice, sequenced at the point the product owner chooses (not necessarily inside Phase B's remaining closeout). Phase B (App Shell: Sidebar, Topbar, Breadcrumb, Notification Center, Search, Command Palette, and their 2026-07-19 icon/radius revision, §23) is considered complete as implemented; Global Context Model is a separately-tracked, frozen-but-unbuilt addition, not a blocker on Phase C.

### 24.9 Scope Boundary — Global Context Is Not an Authorization Mechanism

Global Context defines the application's default **working** context only — what a user sees by default and what a new record targets by default. It is a UX convenience layer, never a security boundary, and it does not substitute for, weaken, or bypass any authorization rule, business rule, or approval workflow defined elsewhere in this architecture:

- Selecting a Branch in the Context Panel does not grant access to that Branch. Whatever branch-scoped role/permission check governs that Branch still applies in full, entirely independent of what's currently selected as Working Context.
- Selecting a non-active Academic Year does not, by itself, grant `modify-historical-records` (§24.5). That permission, its risk-tiered confirmation, and Approval Engine routing apply exactly as specified regardless of the currently-selected Working Year — Global Context supplies a mutation's *default target*, never a reason to skip evaluating whether that mutation is allowed.
- Every mutation, whatever Global Context it inherits its default scope/year from, remains subject to the same permission checks, validation, and approval workflows any other write in the system already goes through. Global Context changes what a form is pre-filled with; it changes nothing about whether submitting that form succeeds.

This clause exists specifically to foreclose a plausible but wrong implementation shortcut: treating "currently selected Branch/Year" as equivalent to "authorized for that Branch/Year." They are two independent systems that happen to share one UI surface — the Context Panel supplies defaults, the permission/approval system decides what's actually allowed — and must never be conflated into one.

## 25. Dashboard Shell (Frozen 2026-07-19)

Reached through a dedicated design review that deliberately rejected a framework-first framing ("a container for future widgets") in favor of a user-first one: a school principal, accountant, HR employee, or teacher should feel the Dashboard answers "what do I need to know and do right now" — even though, as of this freeze, almost nothing that could genuinely answer that question yet exists as real backend capability (§25.5). This phase builds the shell only: layout, composition, the widget registration model, and empty-state discipline. It owns no business domain and no backend work (§25.3).

### 25.1 Composition

`HomePage` becomes the Dashboard shell — extended, not replaced by a second landing page. Three existing, independently-proven mechanisms compose on one page, deliberately not unified into one new abstraction (they already have different shapes, and forcing them together now would be speculative):

1. **Quick Actions** (top) — the existing Phase B registry, previously feeding only the Command Palette; this phase adds it as a second surface here.
2. **Registered Widgets** (main area) — the one genuinely new mechanism: a registration model mirroring `WorkspaceDefinition`'s own pattern, so a future workspace can *optionally* contribute a widget to the shared landing Dashboard. This phase builds the registry, the grid, and permission-aware rendering only — never a specific widget.
3. **Notifications** (compact summary) — the existing Phase B hook, a denser second presentation of the same honest-empty-state `NotificationCenter` already proves.

**Workspace Launcher** (the existing tile grid) stays exactly as it is today, unchanged, anchoring the page beneath the above.

### 25.2 System Initialization vs. Operational Empty States

Two genuinely different empty conditions, requiring two different messages, distinguished by a precise, already-available signal rather than a single generic "nothing here" state:

| State | Signal | Meaning | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| **System Initialization** | `getRegisteredWorkspaces()` (the local, static, build-time registry) is empty | No workspace module has been *built into this deployment* at all — a deployment-level fact, true for every user, not a permission gap | A calm, singular onboarding message: widgets, quick actions, and notifications will appear automatically as modules are enabled. Not fake content or a placeholder widget — a genuine product-level onboarding state, replacing the entire page as its sole content, exactly as `EmptyWorkspaceState` does today. |
| **Operational Empty State** | `getRegisteredWorkspaces()` is non-empty, but `useVisibleWorkspaces()` (the server-filtered, per-user list) returns empty | Workspaces exist in this deployment; this specific user isn't licensed/permitted for any of them | The existing `EmptyWorkspaceState` copy, unchanged — "your account isn't licensed or permitted... contact your administrator" is correct here, specifically because it is *not* true during System Initialization. |

Conflating these was a real risk worth naming explicitly: once real workspaces ship, telling a fresh installation's own Super Admin to "contact your administrator" — when they *are* the administrator, mid-setup — would be actively wrong, not merely unpolished. The two states must never share one message.

Within an *individual* section (Quick Actions, Registered Widgets, Notifications) once at least one workspace is visible, each section's own existing empty-state convention applies independently and quietly (Quick Actions/Widgets render nothing at zero, matching the "correct with zero" bar already set in Phase B; Notifications keeps its existing "you're all caught up" copy) — these are ordinary Operational Empty States, not System Initialization, and do not need the onboarding message repeated per-section.

### 25.3 Design Principle — Presentation and Composition Only

**The Dashboard owns presentation and composition only. Every business capability contributes exclusively through registration.** The shell defines *how* a workspace, a widget, a quick action, or a notification appears — layout, grid behavior, permission-aware rendering, empty-state rules — and never *what* business data appears. No phase that touches the Dashboard shell may add a named, domain-specific section (a Finance KPI, an Approvals list, a Schedule view) directly into the shell's own code; every such capability must arrive as a registration from its owning module, exactly as workspaces already do via `WorkspaceDefinition`. This is the same extension-point discipline already governing `AppShell`/nav/routing (ADR-0015 Decision 4), applied to the Dashboard specifically because "operational from day one" is a strong pull toward embedding real-seeming content directly into shell code — a pull this principle exists to resist.

### 25.4 Status

Frozen design, not yet implemented in code as of this freeze. `Registered Widgets` is the only genuinely new mechanism this phase adds; `Quick Actions` and `Notifications` are existing Phase B primitives gaining a second surface. Implementation is scoped to the shell only — no backend work, no first widget, no Approval Engine list endpoint (§25.5) — per §25.3.

### 25.5 Deferred, Not Owned By This Phase

A dedicated capability check (2026-07-19) found that most of the sections a genuinely operational Dashboard would need do not exist as real backend capability yet, and this phase deliberately does not build any of them:

- **My Pending Approvals** — the Approval Engine (Core) is real and mature, but has no list/query capability at all, not even "list all approval requests," let alone one scoped to the current user. The most likely first real widget once that gap closes, but that backend work belongs to whichever phase owns it, not this one.
- **Recent Activity** — Spatie Activitylog is genuinely recording data across the codebase, but no API exposes any of it yet.
- **Today's Schedule** — no Timetable/Scheduling module exists at all.
- **Critical Alerts** — no mechanism beyond Notifications itself (already empty-state-only today) — not a distinct real capability.
- **Global Context** — deliberately not a Dashboard section; it is Topbar chrome (§24), and duplicating it here would render the same information twice.

None of these are blocked by this phase's design — §25.1's registration model is exactly the mechanism each will use to plug in once its owning module is ready.

## 26. Administration Workspace — Reference Implementation (Frozen 2026-07-19)

Reached through a dedicated UX/product-design review across information architecture, navigation, settings hierarchy, page templates, permission model, configuration philosophy, layout patterns, empty states, responsive behavior, and accessibility, before any code — same discipline as every prior phase.

### 26.1 Purpose and Scope

Administration Workspace is the reference implementation for **configuration-oriented** workspaces specifically, not for every future workspace. Entity-CRUD workspaces (Students, Finance, HR, Library) are a different shape — lists, detail records, create/edit forms — already served by the `DataTable`/`Form` frameworks (Phase 13), and need their own reference proof separately; conflating the two would either pull this workspace toward concerns it doesn't have or leave the entity-CRUD pattern under-designed. First implemented child: **Configuration Platform** (§8.3's nine-child Administration group), the most backend-mature capability (Phase 1).

### 26.2 Information Architecture and Naming

Honors §8.3 verbatim — `Administration` (group) → nine children, with only Configuration Platform registered in this phase; the other eight remain unregistered until their own phases, the same "zero is correct" discipline as the Workspace registry itself. Within Configuration Platform, settings are organized by category (Identity/OTP today; Media/Storage, Notifications/Email later).

**Naming is deliberately two separate things.** "Configuration Platform" is the architectural capability name — it matches the Administration Platform Blueprint's own vocabulary and stays fixed in code, docs, and the backend contract. The end-user-facing navigation label is a distinct, independently-evolvable UX decision, resolved through the existing `labelKey`/i18n mechanism every other workspace already uses (e.g. it may read "System Settings" in the UI) — never hardcoded to the architectural name. A strict one-to-one mapping is maintained between the two; only the label's wording is free to evolve without touching the architecture, the registry key, or any backend contract.

### 26.3 Navigation Model

Two-pane: a search-augmented category rail (left) + the selected category's form (main). Breadcrumb: Home → Administration → [nav label] → [Category], via the existing multi-level `Breadcrumb`, unchanged.

### 26.4 Settings Hierarchy

Default→Global→Branch altitude chain from `SettingsResolver` — confirmed against `ConfigurationScopeContext`'s own docblock during Phase E-B implementation to have no "User" altitude at all; User Preferences are a deliberately separate, lower-ceremony mechanism outside this resolver, not a fourth rung on this chain. A Branch-scoped field's edit view honors the currently-selected Branch from Global Context (§24) — explicit coherence between the two systems, never a bypass (§24.9 applies in full). Each field shows which altitude it is *currently resolving from* ("Using the global default" / "Set globally" / "Set for this branch") via the resolver's real `resolvedFrom` trace (shipped in §26.13's Phase E-B).

### 26.5 Page Templates

`SettingsCategoryList` (rail) + `SettingsCategoryDetail` (card-sectioned form, `StickyActionBar` save, per the already-frozen §10 note) + a generic field renderer keyed off data type, reusing the existing `TextField`/React Hook Form + Zod convention. Approval-gated writes reuse the risk-tiered confirmation taxonomy (§M4/§M7/§M9) already proven for Global Context (§24.5) — a second consumer of the same mechanism, not a new one.

### 26.6 Permission Model

Real, seeded permission strings exist (`identity.view-otp-settings`/`identity.configure-otp-settings`, the view/edit split per ADR-0018 Decision 9), enforced server-side by the real adapter API (§26.13's Phase E-B) — not a client-side bypass. View-gating bypasses for `is_super_admin`, matching `WorkspaceAccessResolver`'s coarse nav-gating philosophy; edit-gating deliberately does **not** bypass for `is_super_admin` in either the `canEdit` flag or the write endpoint itself, both deferring entirely to `SettingsResolver::assertCanEdit()`'s existing, unmodified behavior — so `canEdit: true` never promises more than a subsequent write would actually allow. View-but-not-edit renders disabled with an explanatory note, never hidden. A category with zero visible permitted settings does not appear in the rail at all (§8.4, extended one level deeper).

### 26.7 Configuration Philosophy

This workspace's entire purpose is showing *real* resolved values — unlike Login's wordmark fallback, there is no meaningful default to fall back to. Honesty here means real data or an explicit "not yet connected" state, never a plausible-looking mock.

### 26.8 Reusable Layout Patterns

The two-pane rail+content shape, `StickyActionBar`, card-sectioned form groups, and the existing `WorkspaceHeader` — deliberately reusable by Administration's other eight children and by any future workspace's own settings page.

### 26.9 Empty States

Three distinct conditions, not one generic state: zero categories registered system-wide (a System-Initialization-style message, §25.2's precedent); a category exists with no Branch-level override set ("using Global default" — a real, non-broken state, not an error); no permission to view a category (absent from the rail entirely, per §26.6).

### 26.10 Responsive Behavior

Two-pane desktop collapses to a single-pane drill-down on mobile (category list → detail → back) — never a hidden rail, matching the Sidebar (§5) and Login brand column (§20.1) precedent.

### 26.11 Accessibility

Category rail as a real nav landmark (`aria-label`, matching `Breadcrumb`/`SideNav`'s existing convention). `StickyActionBar`'s Save button needs a deliberately sensible keyboard tab order on long forms — sticky visual positioning alone does not fix tab order.

### 26.12 Registration Principle

Administration's children are discovered **exclusively** through the existing `WorkspaceDefinition` registration mechanism (§8.2's `group` field) — the same registry every other workspace already uses, never a bespoke Administration-only mechanism. The Administration Workspace shell itself never assumes any specific child is present: it must render correctly with zero children registered (the Workspace registry's own zero-is-correct discipline, unchanged), with only Configuration Platform registered (this phase's actual state), or with all nine eventually registered — no conditional logic anywhere keyed to a specific child's presence. This is ADR-0015 Decision 4's extension-point discipline, applied one level deeper, inside the Administration group itself.

### 26.13 Implementation Plan

- **Phase E-A (frontend infrastructure)**: layout, navigation, page templates, permission-aware rendering, responsive behavior, accessibility, and empty-state handling — verified against a temporary, fully-reverted fixture (the same discipline already proven for Phase B's Sidebar and Phase D), since real data flow does not exist yet.
- **Phase E-B (Configuration Platform integration)**: a thin adapter-layer REST API exposing `SettingsResolver`/`ConfigurationRegistry` (and later `ProviderManager` for Provider Registry) — reusing existing services verbatim, no business-logic changes, HTTP wiring only. Sequenced after E-A, explicitly scoped, preserving the standing rule that backend capability is exposed before the UI depends on it.

**API stability principle.** Once E-B ships it, the REST API surface becomes the stable public contract between frontend and backend — its shape (request/response structure, field names, error format) is what the frontend depends on and must not change without a deliberate, versioned decision. The internal PHP services behind it (`SettingsResolver`, `ConfigurationRegistry`, `ProviderManager`) remain free to evolve, refactor, or be reimplemented entirely, as long as the contract they serve stays stable — the adapter/controller layer is the boundary that insulates the frontend from internal implementation churn, never a pass-through that couples the two.

**Phase E-B shipped (2026-07-20).** `ConfigurationController` (`GET /api/v1/administration/configuration/categories`, `GET .../categories/{key}/settings`, `PATCH .../categories/{key}/settings/{fieldKey}`) is a thin adapter over `SettingsResolver`/`ConfigurationRegistry` verbatim, per this section's own principle — no business-logic changes. The contract is defined once, in `@alphaschool/contracts` (ADR-0023), and consumed by both `real-configuration-provider.ts` and the Pest Feature test suite. `/api/v1/workspaces` (§26.6/ADR-0018) was also wired to real permission-based visibility in this same phase — `WorkspaceAccessResolver` previously returned `[]` unconditionally, which would have made this workspace unreachable regardless of E-B's own work.

### 26.14 Status

Frozen design. Phase E-A and Phase E-B are both shipped and verified — real backend, real Pest Feature tests, real browser E2E check (login → Overview Grid → category detail, real OTP field values, correct `resolvedFrom`/`canEdit` states, RTL and dark mode, no console errors). Configuration Platform's `ConfigurationDataProvider` is genuinely connected, not a fixture; §26.7/§26.9's "not connected" state remains correct only for a deployment that never registers this workspace's provider. Remaining Administration children (eight of nine) are still unregistered, per §26.12.

### 26.15 Overview Grid Refinement (2026-07-19)

An append-only amendment to §26.3/§26.5, not a supersession of the two-pane rail+content interface itself — that interface is unchanged, it simply stops being the first thing a user sees.

System Settings now lands on a responsive card-grid overview (3 columns desktop / 2 tablet / 1 mobile) before the rail+detail interface, each card representing one configuration area: a soft outline icon, the area's name, a single status indicator (`Ready` / `Needs Setup` / `Error`, shown as a small colored badge — never a chart, counter, or stat), and an optional one-line secondary note (e.g. the active provider). The entire card is clickable and opens the existing two-pane interface with that category pre-selected; a back affordance (now shown on every breakpoint, not mobile-only as originally built) returns to the overview.

Deliberately modeled on modern Settings-surface precedent (Apple/Linear/Notion/Stripe), not an analytics-dashboard precedent — this is why status is a single small badge, never a number, and why no chart or counter is permitted on a card regardless of what data becomes available once Phase E-B ships. `SettingCategory` (§26.13) gained `icon`, `status`, and an optional `secondaryLine` to support this — an additive extension of the same provider contract, not a new mechanism; Phase E-B's job is unchanged, only the shape of what it returns grew by three fields. Visual treatment stays inside the frozen enterprise radius scale (§23.2) — cards use `rounded-md`, not a larger radius, so this refinement does not reopen the flatter, more enterprise-appropriate surface §23 already established.

### 26.16 The Overview Grid Pattern (2026-07-19)

A same-day amendment to §26.15, superseding its grid-column count — the card content model (icon, name, one status badge, optional secondary line, no charts/counters/stats) and the card→two-pane→back interaction are unchanged.

**Grid**: 6 columns on large desktop, 4 on medium, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile — supersedes §26.15's 3/2/1. Verified live at exactly these four breakpoints.

**A named pattern, not a list of exceptions.** The System Settings overview card treatment — square corners, soft elevation, a subtle hover lift — is not a one-off deviation from §23.2/§4.4 tolerated for this single page. It is the **Overview Grid Pattern**: a distinct, reusable UI pattern for high-density navigation surfaces, alongside (not instead of) the standard Card treatment those two sections already govern.

| | Standard Cards (§23.2) | Overview Grid Pattern (this section) |
|---|---|---|
| Radius | `sm`–`md` (4–6px) | `rounded-none` — square corners are this pattern's own defining trait, not an overshoot of the standard scale |
| Hover motion | none (§4.4's calm, flat motion language) | a subtle lift (`translateY(-2px)`) + strengthened shadow, `transition-[transform,box-shadow]` only |
| Elevation | `shadow-soft` at rest | `shadow-soft` at rest, `shadow-soft-lg` on hover — both existing §4.3 tokens, no new shadow value |
| Intended use | detail pages, forms, dashboard widgets — anywhere content is read or edited | dense grids of clickable navigation entries — System Settings today, plausibly Provider Registry / Integrations / AI Providers later, anywhere an "overview of areas to enter" is the page's whole job |

§23.2 and §4.4 remain exactly as frozen for every other card and every other hover interaction in the product — this section adds a second, named pattern for a specific surface shape, rather than carving a hole in the first one. Any future page reaching for square corners or a hover lift should ask whether it is genuinely an overview/navigation grid (and therefore this pattern) or a detail/content surface (and therefore standard Cards) — the two are deliberately kept visually distinct so a user can tell which kind of page they're on at a glance.

A fourth status value, **`Disabled`** (a muted badge, matching the existing `Badge` `muted` variant — no new color introduced), was added to `SettingCategoryStatus` for a capability that exists in the taxonomy but isn't reachable yet — the card renders non-interactive (`disabled`, reduced opacity, `cursor-not-allowed`) rather than clickable-but-pointless.

Colors and shadow reuse existing tokens verbatim — no new color or shadow value was introduced. Dark-mode `--background`/`--card` already produce the requested "dark charcoal, cards slightly lighter" relationship; `shadow-soft`/`shadow-soft-lg` (§4.3) already produce a soft, non-glowing shadow, reused directly rather than hand-rolling a new one-off value.

## 27. Provider Registry — the second Administration child

Reached through a dedicated design review against the real Phase 2 backend (`ProviderManager`, `ProviderCredentialVault`, `HealthCheckRunner`, `ProviderRegistry::sync()`), not assumed to be a copy of §26 — Provider Registry's actual shape differs from Configuration Platform's in three ways significant enough to change the design, not just the data source.

### 27.1 Purpose and Scope

The second implemented child of §8.3's nine-child Administration group (`Configuration Platform` ✅ → `Provider Registry` → …), reusing every proven mechanism from §26 (Overview Grid, `WorkspaceHeader`, `StickyActionBar`, the permission model's view/edit asymmetry, real-data-only philosophy, Docker environment) rather than re-deriving them — the explicit reason this child was sequenced immediately after Configuration Platform and before any new business-domain workspace.

### 27.2 The Three Real Differences From Configuration Platform

1. **Credential values are never exposed, in either direction.** `ProviderCredential.credentials` is `$hidden`; Phase 2's own negative-case proofs verify a secret never appears in any model array/JSON representation. Configuration's field renderer shows a resolved *value*; Provider Registry's can only ever show whether a credential is *configured* — write-only inputs, never pre-filled with a previous value, not even masked dots standing in for a real one (there is no real one to fetch).
2. **No per-slot view permission exists.** `ProviderSlotDefinition` declares only `requiredPermissionToEdit` — unlike `SettingDefinition`'s mandatory view/edit pair (ADR-0018 Decision 9). Resolved explicitly (§27.6), not left implicit: since a slot's *metadata* (name, owning module, health status) carries no real risk on its own — the only sensitive thing, credential values, is never returned regardless of who's asking — visibility is gated by ordinary Administration access, not a per-slot permission that doesn't exist in the schema to check.
3. **Flatter granularity.** A Configuration category holds several independently-editable fields, justifying the rail-then-detail two-pane shape (§26.3). A provider slot is one atomic, all-or-nothing credential set — `ProviderCredentialVault::write()`'s `assertCredentialShape()` requires the exact declared field set on every write, no partial saves. There is nothing to browse *within* a slot, so a rail adds a click with no destination behind it.

### 27.3 Navigation Model

**Overview Grid → direct credential form, no intermediate rail.** The Overview Grid (§26.16) is reused exactly as-is as the landing page — each card represents one provider slot (e.g. "Email — SMTP", "Push Notifications — Firebase"). Clicking a card opens that slot's credential form directly, skipping the category-rail step §26.3 uses for Configuration Platform, since there is no second level of hierarchy to browse. Breadcrumb: Home → Administration → Provider Registry → [Slot], via the same multi-level `Breadcrumb` component, one level shallower than Configuration Platform's because the rail level doesn't exist here.

In shorthand: `Configuration Platform = Overview Grid → Category → Settings Form`, `Provider Registry = Overview Grid → Provider Form` — the underlying design system (tokens, primitives, permission model, Docker environment) stays identical; each workspace's navigation depth matches its own actual data shape rather than forcing a shared template deeper or shallower than the domain warrants.

### 27.4 Data Model Exposed

Per slot: `slotKey`, a display name (`labelKey`, mirroring §26.2's naming decoupling — `slot_key` stays the fixed architectural identifier, the label is independently translatable), `owningModule`, `capabilityContract` (not shown to the end user — internal wiring only, and per §27.5's naming-branch rule, never used by the frontend to decide *anything* either), and the declared `credentialFields`.

**Amendment (2026-07-20, pre-freeze review):** `credentialFields` is not a bare list of field names. Each entry declares its own type explicitly at the backend — `{ name: string, type: 'text' | 'password' | 'secret' }` — never inferred client-side from the field's name. A frontend heuristic keyed on names like `password`/`secret`/`key` is a list that only ever grows (`client_secret`, `private_token`, `signing_certificate`, …) and silently mis-renders the day a genuinely new field name doesn't match it; the backend already knows what each field is because it's the one declaring `credentialFields` in the first place, so it says so directly. This is a real contract change from the Phase 2 scaffold's plain `string[]` shape, landing in Phase F-B (§27.13) alongside the four existing Providers' declarations.

`status` is derived from `HealthCheckRunner::check()`, with a fifth value added specifically for this workspace's overview: `healthy` → `Ready`, `unhealthy` → `Error`, no credential configured at any altitude → `Needs Setup`, `not_checkable` (a resolved Provider not implementing `HealthCheckable`) → `Disabled` (§26.16's fourth status value, already anticipated for exactly this case), and **`checking`** → *Checking…*, shown while the status fetch (initial load) or an explicit re-check is in flight. `checking` is deliberately a client-only transient state, never a value `HealthCheckRunner`'s synchronous v1 API itself returns — it belongs to the same vocabulary as the other four purely so the Overview Grid's badge component has one enum to render from, not because the backend has a fifth real state. No chart, counter, or last-checked timestamp on the card itself, matching §26.15/§26.16's standing rule against turning an overview card into a stat.

### 27.5 Page Templates

The Overview Grid component is reused verbatim from Configuration Platform — zero changes, proving §26.16's own claim that the pattern generalizes to "plausibly Provider Registry... later." A new `ProviderCredentialForm` (structurally: `WorkspaceHeader` + card-sectioned form + `StickyActionBar` Save, the same shell §26.5 already established) replaces `SettingsCategoryDetail`/`SettingField` for this workspace — its field renderer is new, not reused, because its contract is fundamentally different (no `value` prop exists to pass it). Each declared credential field renders using the `type` the backend declared for it (§27.4) — `text` as a plain input, `password`/`secret` as a masked input — never a name-based guess. All render empty regardless of type, with a placeholder reading "configured" or "not set" rather than a real value.

**Two rules added during pre-freeze review (2026-07-20), both binding on Phase F-A/F-B:**

- **The UI never branches on `capabilityContract` or on any vendor/slot identity.** No `if (slotKey === 'notifications.email.smtp')`, no switch on `capabilityContract`, anywhere in this workspace's frontend code — every rendering decision (which fields, what type each one is, what status badge to show) comes from the API response's declared metadata, exactly mirroring `ProviderManager`'s own backend discipline ("No vendor name ever appears in a switch/match/if-chain here or anywhere else in this class"). This is what keeps adding a fifth, sixth, tenth provider a pure registration act instead of a growing pile of frontend conditionals.
- **Test Connection never persists.** The flow is Edit → Test → (result shown inline) → Save, never Edit → Save → Test. The "Test Connection" affordance (§27.7) sends the form's *currently-typed, unsaved* field values to a dedicated test endpoint and shows the result without writing anything to the Vault — a manager can try a value, see it fail, and correct it before ever committing a bad credential. This requires a backend-side capability beyond today's `HealthCheckable::healthCheck()` (which only ever reads the already-persisted credential via the Vault); see §27.13 for the new contract this needs.

Save submits every declared field at once (never a per-field PATCH, matching the Vault's all-or-nothing write contract) and requires the current `expectedVersion` exactly as Configuration's optimistic-locking contract already does.

### 27.6 Permission Model

**Resolves §27.2's second difference explicitly.** Viewing the Overview Grid and any provider slot's card/metadata requires no per-slot permission — visible to anyone with general Administration access (mirroring `WorkspaceAccessResolver`'s existing coarse nav-gating philosophy, §26.6's own precedent). Editing a slot's credentials requires exactly the permission declared on that slot's `ProviderSlotDefinition.requiredPermissionToEdit` (e.g. `notifications.manage-email-provider`) — checked by `ProviderCredentialVault::assertCanEdit()`, unmodified, the same "the write endpoint is the real gate, the UI flag is just an accurate preview of it" discipline §26.6 established for Configuration, including the identical `is_super_admin` asymmetry: the view-level bypass (Overview Grid, card visibility) applies to Super Admin per the "general Administration access" rule above, but the edit-level check does not bypass — `canEdit` never promises more than a subsequent write would actually allow.

### 27.7 Configuration Philosophy

Same standing rule as §26.7: real resolved state or an explicit not-connected state, never a plausible-looking mock. A slot with no credential configured at any altitude shows `Needs Setup` as a genuine, correct state — not an error, not hidden. Health-check results are read directly from `HealthCheckRunner`'s existing 60-second cache; the Overview Grid displays whatever that cache currently holds (showing `Checking…`, §27.4, while that initial fetch is in flight) rather than forcing a live check on every page load. The credential form's "Test Connection" affordance is a genuinely different operation from the Overview Grid's cached badge — it tests the *unsaved, currently-typed* values (§27.5's Edit→Test→Save rule), never the persisted credential, and never writes anything regardless of the result — the one interaction this workspace has that Configuration Platform's design didn't need.

### 27.8 Reusable Layout Patterns

The Overview Grid Pattern (§26.16) gains its second real consumer here, confirming it as a genuine cross-workspace pattern rather than a one-off. `WorkspaceHeader`, `StickyActionBar`, `Breadcrumb`, and the risk-tiered approval-confirmation taxonomy (reused for `approval_required` slots exactly as Configuration Platform reuses it) all carry over unchanged.

### 27.9 Empty States

Three conditions, mirroring §26.9's taxonomy one level flatter (no per-category empty state exists here since there's no rail): zero provider slots registered system-wide (System Initialization, unlikely in practice since four slots are already registered, but the shell must still render correctly at zero per the Registration Principle, §27.12); a slot with `Needs Setup` status (a real, non-error state, per §27.7); no Administration access at all (workspace absent from the Sidebar entirely, per `WorkspaceAccessResolver`).

### 27.10 Responsive Behavior

Identical to §26.10/§26.16 — the Overview Grid's 6/4/2/1-column breakpoints are reused verbatim. The credential form (replacing the two-pane rail+detail on mobile) is a single-column form at every breakpoint, since there was never a rail to collapse.

### 27.11 Accessibility

Same conventions as §26.11 — `StickyActionBar`'s Save button keeps a deliberate tab order; write-only credential inputs get real `autocomplete="new-password"`-style hints where the field name implies a secret, so password managers don't attempt to fill them with an unrelated stored credential.

### 27.12 Registration Principle

Unchanged from §26.12, applied to this child specifically: Provider Registry registers into the same `WorkspaceDefinition` registry as every other workspace, under the same Administration `group`. The Administration shell's own "correct with zero, one, or all nine children" guarantee is what makes adding this second child a pure registration act, not a shell change.

### 27.13 Implementation Plan

Mirrors §26.13's own two-phase split, for the identical reason it existed there: the backend (`ProviderManager`/`ProviderCredentialVault`/`HealthCheckRunner`) already exists and is tested, so most of the capability is already there — but pre-freeze review (§27.4/§27.5) surfaced two real, narrow backend contract changes that Phase F-B must make, unlike Configuration Platform's Phase E-B, which needed none:

1. **`ProviderSlotDefinition.credentialFields` gains a type per field.** Today it's `string[]` (Phase 2 scaffold). Becomes an array of `{ name: string, type: 'text' | 'password' | 'secret' }`. Touches: the VO itself, `ProviderRegistry::sync()`'s validation (`assertCredentialFieldsDeclared`), `ProviderCredentialVault::assertCredentialShape()` (extracts names from the richer shape), `ProviderRegistration.credential_fields`'s stored JSON shape (no migration needed, still an `array` cast), and all four existing Providers' `providerSlots()` declarations (`SmtpEmailProvider`, `GoogleOAuthProvider`, `FirebasePushProvider`, `R2StorageProvider`) — each field gets its real type assigned once, by the module that actually knows what it is.
2. **A new contract for testing unsaved credentials.** `HealthCheckable::healthCheck()` only ever reads the already-persisted credential via the Vault — it has no way to test a value the form-filler hasn't saved yet. A new sibling interface (e.g. `TestsCredentials` with `testCredentials(array $credentials): bool`) lets a Provider validate a given, in-memory credential set without touching the Vault at all, satisfying §27.5's Edit→Test→Save rule. Optional, exactly like `HealthCheckable` itself — a Provider with no meaningful pre-save test simply doesn't implement it, and the form's Test Connection button is absent rather than fake.

- **Phase F-A (frontend infrastructure)**: the Overview Grid reused as-is against a temporary fixture provider (fixture slots exercising `Ready`/`Needs Setup`/`Error`/`Disabled`/`Checking…`, with fixture `credentialFields` already carrying real `type` values so the field renderer is built against the real contract from day one, not retrofitted in F-B), `ProviderCredentialForm`'s type-driven field renderer, the Test Connection flow (against the fixture, since the real `TestsCredentials` contract lands in F-B), permission-aware rendering per §27.6, responsive/accessibility verification — the same fixture-then-revert discipline as every prior phase.
- **Phase F-B (Provider Registry integration)**: the two backend contract changes above, a thin adapter-layer REST API exposing `ProviderManager`/`ProviderCredentialVault`/`HealthCheckRunner`/the new test-credentials path (no unrelated business-logic changes, mirroring §26.13's own API stability principle), `@alphaschool/contracts` gains a `providers` feature folder alongside its existing `settings` one, and the real four already-registered slots become the real, non-fixture proof data.

### 27.14 Status

Frozen design (2026-07-20), revised once during pre-freeze review the same day: explicit backend-declared field types replacing a name-based heuristic (§27.4/§27.5), Test Connection's never-persists / Edit→Test→Save sequencing (§27.5/§27.7), a client-only `Checking…` transient status (§27.4), and a binding rule against the UI ever branching on capability contracts or vendor identity (§27.5). All four incorporated before this freeze, not deferred.

**Phase F-A COMPLETE (2026-07-20).** `admin/src/platform/administration/overview-grid.tsx` is the Overview Grid Pattern promoted to a shared component (its second real consumer, confirming §26.16's own claim it would generalize) -- Configuration Platform's usage was updated to the same import, its own workspace-scoped copy deleted, zero behavior change. `admin/src/platform/administration/provider-registry-provider.ts` is the data contract (`ProviderSlot`/`ProviderSlotDetail`/`ProviderCredentialFieldDefinition` with an explicit `type`/`testCredentials`/`writeCredentials`), and `admin/src/workspaces/administration-provider-registry/` holds the real page templates: `provider-registry-page.tsx` (Overview Grid → direct form, §27.3), `provider-credential-field.tsx` (type-driven rendering, never a name heuristic), `provider-credential-form.tsx` (the Edit→Test→Save flow, §27.5/§27.7), `register.ts` (registers the workspace shell only -- no real provider wired yet, mirroring Phase E-A's own split from E-B exactly). Verified live against a temporary fixture (five slots exercising all five statuses including the transient `checking`→`ready` transition; a `canEdit: false` slot proving the view-only path with no Test/Save controls; a real Test→Save round trip proving Test never persists, confirmed by the pending form state surviving a successful test unchanged), RTL/Arabic, dark mode, and mobile -- all fully reverted before commit (zero `git diff` on the fixture wiring, confirmed). `tsc -b` clean, `oxlint` clean (same pre-existing warnings, none new). Phase F-B (the real backend adapter, plus the two new backend contracts §27.13 specified) remains, its own separately-scoped task.

**Phase F-B COMPLETE (2026-07-21).** Both backend contract changes from §27.13 are live: `ProviderCredentialFieldDefinition` (`{name, type}`, `TYPE_TEXT`/`TYPE_PASSWORD`/`TYPE_SECRET`) replaces the plain `string[]` shape everywhere it flowed -- `ProviderSlotDefinition`, `ProviderRegistry::sync()`'s validation, `ProviderCredentialVault::assertCredentialShape()`, and all four existing Providers' declarations (`SmtpEmailProvider`, `GoogleOAuthProvider`, `FirebasePushProvider`, `R2StorageProvider`), each now assigning its own fields' real types. `TestsCredentials` (`testCredentials(array $credentials): bool`), a `HealthCheckable` sibling, is implemented by all four Providers, satisfying §27.5's Edit→Test→Save rule without touching the Vault. A new `ProviderRegistryController` exposes the adapter REST API (`GET /administration/providers`, `GET /administration/providers/{slotKey}`, `POST /administration/providers/{slotKey}/test`, `PATCH /administration/providers/{slotKey}`), and `@alphaschool/contracts` gained a `providers` feature folder mirroring `settings`'s own shape, including a `TestProviderCredentialsResponseSchema` deliberately shaped as just `{ ok: boolean }` -- `TestsCredentials` returns a plain bool, mirroring `HealthCheckable`'s own conservative, message-less result, so the frontend never invents a diagnostic string the backend didn't send.

§27.6's permission model needed one real addition surfaced mid-implementation, not present in the original design: no per-slot *view* permission existed anywhere in `WorkspaceAccessResolver` to gate the workspace itself on (only per-slot *edit* permissions did). Resolved by explicit product decision: a dedicated `administration.providers.view` permission (new `administration` permission group) gates the workspace's visibility in the Sidebar, independent of and never inferred from the union of per-slot edit permissions -- `administration.providers.view` → can see and open Provider Registry; a provider-specific edit permission → can modify that one provider's credentials. `WorkspaceAccessResolver` now includes `provider-registry` in its resolved workspace list only when the acting user holds that permission (or `is_super_admin`, matching the existing view-gating bypass -- edit-gating, unchanged, never bypasses even for `is_super_admin`, since `ProviderCredentialVault::assertCanEdit()` is untouched).

`register.ts` now wires `realProviderRegistryDataProvider` permanently (mirroring E-A→E-B's own split), and the F-A fixture files are deleted, not archived. Verified: 11 new Pest feature tests in `ProviderRegistryControllerTest.php` cover the full slots/detail/test/write/permission/version-conflict matrix end-to-end over real HTTP, including a dedicated test proving Test Connection never persists -- fetch, test, fetch again and assert zero change, save, fetch again and assert the change is now present, so the non-persistence claim is proven by database state, not by UI action sequencing alone. Full backend suite: 354 passing (12 pre-existing, separately-tracked failures unrelated to this work, unchanged -- **superseded, see the correction note below**). Live browser verification against the real Docker backend (not a fixture): all four real slots (`media.storage.r2`, `notifications.email.smtp`, `identity.federation.google-oauth`, `notifications.push.firebase`) list correctly with real `owningModule`/status data; the R2 slot's detail view renders its four real fields with the real backend-declared types (`key`/`secret` masked, `region`/`endpoint` plain text) and correctly disables all of them with the view-only note for a user with `administration.providers.view` but no edit permission on that slot; RTL/Arabic and dark mode both verified live against the real adapter; network and console clean (zero new errors). Edit/Test/Save/permission/version-conflict mechanics for a non-super-admin, edit-permitted user rely on the 11 Pest tests above rather than live browser verification, for the same documented reason as Phase E-B: Spatie Permission's Teams `setPermissionsTeamId()` only resolves correctly within one PHP process, never across real HTTP requests, so a genuine multi-permission browser scenario cannot be constructed against the real backend.

**Notable operational finding, unrelated to this design or its implementation:** during this phase's live-verification setup, the database was found completely empty (zero rows in every table, including `users`, `organizations`, `provider_registrations`) despite an intact, fully-migrated schema. No root cause was identified -- container recreation, config-caching, and a wrong-database mixup were each checked and ruled out. State was restored via `db:seed` plus the existing `administration:sync-settings`/`administration:sync-providers` commands before verification continued. This is flagged here for visibility since it was discovered mid-phase and has not yet been separately investigated or resolved.

**Correction (2026-07-21):** the finding above and the "12 pre-existing failures" a few sentences earlier were the same root cause, not two separate findings, and it has since been found, reproduced live, and fixed -- `php artisan test` was silently connecting to the real MariaDB dev database instead of the isolated in-memory SQLite `phpunit.xml` declares, so every test run dropped and recreated every table (`RefreshDatabase`'s `migrate:fresh`) in the real dev database; the MariaDB-specific strict-mode column enforcement behind the 12 failures doesn't apply once tests correctly run against SQLite. Both statements above were accurate reports of what was known at the time of writing, not errors -- this note supersedes their conclusions, not their honesty. With the fix in place the full suite passes 367/367. Full RCA, live reproduction, and fix: `docs/developer/rca-2026-07-21-test-database-wipe.md`.
